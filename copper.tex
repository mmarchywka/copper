While much is not known about cartilage crosslinking,
turnover, and remodeling some recent results do point
to unexpected beneficial effects of copper mediated
cross linking over week time scales \cite{PMID25907046}.
Copper deficiency has been associated with lung
development defects in rats \cite{PMC2018314} and airway and arteriole elastin
were at least partially restored after 60 days of additional copper.
In poultry,
infection is known to cause some tracheal symptoms \cite{PMID9835339}
and  relationship to copper status is considered.
Copper-garlic may reduce the virulence of some of these for short periods
even if not completely able to clear a pathogen\cite{PMC4542191}
and in particular Cu was recently shown to be effective against
the toxin of one anaerobe  \cite{doi:10.1021/jacs.7b01084} .
Collapsed trachea in dogs does not appear to be commonly associated
with copper in the
literature we found although copper storage disease seems to be an
active area of investigation\cite{PMC4783930}
 and copper status does come up
in other investigations of tracheal damage as highlighted above.
It is possible that the original motivation
 is partially correct and that extra copper combined with garlic did
 allow for better crosslinking to stiffen tracheal cartilage and
 prevent dynamic collapse and "honking".

Dilated and hypertrophic cardiac myopathy can both
be related to mitrochondria and "oxidative stress"
may be a signal for more copper. "Oxidative stress"
has been reported to increase muscle mass while 
reducing performance \cite{Ahn_Ranjit_Premkumar_Mitochondrial_oxidative_stress_impairs_2019}.
Copper deficiency can lead to cardiac hypertrophy with increased
mitochondria \cite{PMID12539966}.
"Oxidative stress" is often blamed in the literature as 
a cause of various problems but it may in fact also be a signal.
ROS signalling is well known by now but specifically
it may help get sufficient copper to the mitochondria.

Copper is essential for many growth processes and can activate
receptor tyrosine kinases without a ligand making it
a target for cancer \cite{PMC6537018}.



Copper loading
of cytochrome C oxidase relies on an oxidized
Cox11 to interact with Cox19 \cite{Bode01072015} and this may be inhibited
by GSH but is enhanced by GSSG. Redox regulation in the IMS seems to be integral
to proper copper disposition \cite{IUB:IUB1620} and indeed mitochondrial
related signaling \cite{PMC5448071} . The latter reference also points
to tissue specific mitochondrial isoform expression suggesting that maybe
some related diseases are states rather than traits and hence correctable with
signaling.
 Certainly excess antioxidants would be suspicious ( for example reference 24
\cite{PMC3852343} in \cite{PMC5448071}) .
However, the enhancement by GSSG suggests that the presence of oxidized antioxidants
may be beneficial but not in their reduced state.


Over the  same time however, concerns about diet linked
DCM in dogs have emerged.  A genetic link is also being
investgated and a recent GWAS pointed to two genes,
RNF207 and PRKAA2 as risk factors \cite{PMC10506233}
 but did not mention copper. 
However, RNF207 may mediate degradation of ATP7A
\cite{Zhao_Zeng_Wang_Targeting_2023}
while PRKAA2 comes up in cuproptosis 
\cite{10.3389/fcell.2022.996307}.

Dobermans are at remarkably high risk of DCM 
\cite{Ezer_Saarinen_Katayama_Identification_novel_genetic_2023}.
Interestingly, "standard Dobermans" are also at high risk for hypothyroidism
\cite{PMC9552398}.


Its possible the two concerns are related in more copper
is being absorbed as less is  transported to target organs
such as the heart.
This connection between dysregulated copper metabolism and 
heart disease has been considered recently in humans
\cite{PMC8838622} in a work that reviews many important
aspects of copper metabolism. .

Combined copper and zinc deficiency was observed to
reduce response to \mjmdisease mRNA vaccines with only
minimal copper deficiency 
\cite{Chillon_Demircan_Hackler_Combined_copper_zinc_2023}
The present work considers copper status in light of
other nutrients notably amino acids such as Trp
and Tyr and with zinc being a possible competitor.


In human health, zinc seems to have taken precedence over copper
most recently with some headlines related to the \mjmdisease
pandemic
\cite{Ata_Bradshaw_Zinc_Supplementation_induced_Copper_2024}
\cite{PMC8970610}
. 
Some studies suggest copper is not a factor in \mjmdisease
due to measurements like serum copper levels
\cite{Rozemeijer_Hamer_Heijboer_Micronutrient_Status_Critically_2024}
although ceruloplasmin as an acute phase protein
can elevate levels  during stress even with a 
deficiency in copper
\cite{Harvey_McArdle_Biomarkers_copper_status_2008}.
In  sample of 70 patients presrribed zinc, many had symptoms consistent
with copper deficiency \cite{PMID26085547}



Copper may antagonize many pathogens including
H pylori
\cite{Bernegger_Brunner_VizoviUx0161badcharvv353ek_novel_FRET_peptide_2020}

Deficiency seems to effect prefernetially proteins involved
in neuronal projection and diabetes and iron handling
\cite{PMID36583241}.

Rats fed a copper deficient diet shows neurological symptoms
by 7 weeks and had reduced tyrosine hydroxylase and
SOD activity ZZ
\cite{Morgan_ODell_EFFECT_COPPER_DEFICIENCY_1977}.

A 2017 study explored the effects of copper and vitamin C
as well as other molecules such as
clioquninol on abeta and in vitro neurons suggesting
abeta could be cleaved by copper in the presence of oxygen
as well as an anti-oxidant such as vitamin C although
restoration of neuronal functioning was only partial
\cite{C7SC01787A}.
Interestingly, copper-ascorbate oxidation of tryptophan may be
suppressed by Trp chelation of copper at high trp concentrations
\cite{PMID27406076}
suggesting reduced amounts may give copper more ability to damage
an already low supply.
This is interesting in terms of a utrient interaction hypothesis
on copper toxicity.
And in fact as early as 2012 it was determined that
tryptophan intake could reduce copper toxicity at least in carp
\cite{Hoseini_Hosseini_Soudagar_Dietary_tryptophan_changes_serum_2012}.


Some precednce for metal modulated toxicity existed back to 1999
when work with cultured neurons showed a dose dependent
reduction in abeta toxicity with Zn \cite{Lovell_Xie_Markesbery_Protection_against_amyloid_beta_1999}.
By 2005 toxicity of amyloid beta and the metals zinc, iron, and
copper was investigated under conditions that created more toxicity
with iron and zinc but not copper while amyloid beta reduced metal
toxicity in rats
\cite{Bishop_Robinson_Amyloid_Paradox_AmyloidupbetaMetal_2004}.
In 2021, Ni was found in important amounts in a commercial
abeta40 preparation
\cite{Benoit_Maier_nickel_chelator_dimethylglyoxime_2021}
and was found to mediate dityrosine crosslinks
\cite{Berntsson_Vosough_Svantesson_Residue_specific_binding_2023}
similar to the dityrosine crosslinks induced by copper
found in 2004
\cite{Atwood_Perry_Zeng_Copper_Mediates_Dityrosine_Cross_2004}.

A 2013 work found in vitro physiological conditions
caused copper to prevent fibril formation
\cite{Mold_OuroGnao_Wieckowski_Copper_prevents_amyloid_upbeta1_2013}.

By 2022,  work focusing on moving copper into the cell considered
many aspects of copper misallocation and devised a copper specific
shuttle peptide to deliver Cu from abeta  \cite{D2SC02593K}.

One work in  2022 addressed
AD as a consequence of copper deficnecy because
\cite{Klevay_contemporaneous_epidemic_2022}
\begin{quote}
It is hypothesised that copper deficiency is a plausible cause of Alzheimer's
disease(Reference Klevay84). Patients are thinner than normal; weight loss
precedes dementia and is associated with greater dementia and neurobehavioural
symptoms. Nutritional compromise contributes to morbidity. Cytochrome oxidase
depends on copper for activity; at least fourteen publications reveal decreased
activity in brain of Alzheimer's patients. Brain copper and caeruloplasmin
also are decreased. This hypothesis is the only one that explains why Alzheimer's
disease occurs earlier and is more common in Down's syndrome. Superoxide
dismutase (SOD1) depends on copper for activity; its gene is on chromosome
21. This enzyme is elevated in Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) and is decreased
in people with monosomy. It seems likely that people with Down's syndrome
have a higher than average requirement for dietary copper because copper
is incorporated into superoxide dismutase and is unavailable for other uses.
Thus, Alzheimer's disease fulfills the first two of Golden's criteria (above)
for deficiency.

\end{quote}


Folklore regarding copper persists and yet clinical trials
for Cu in arthritis continue to show lack of any benefit
\cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0071529}
even as other controlled tests show some effects of Cu on
processes related to collagen properties
\cite{PMID6110524}

Remarkably, copper sulfae was shown to protect against
ETC damage by MPP \cite{RUBIOOSORNIO20171} suggesting
some activity against toxic insults.
Copper histidine is used to treat Menkes disease
which is a defect in ATP7A
\cite{Munakata_Sakamoto_Kitamura_effects_copper_2005}.



At least one report found a potentially meaningful association
between copper intake and kidney stone odds ratio
with a non-linear but monotonic inverse relationship
\cite{PMC9469499}. This is interesting in the case of Hershey
who was found to have bladder stones.  


\mjmtol{ this may not belong here but relevant to
other Cu stuff,
A recently published work suggests copper delivery is the
important part of a new ALS drug but the work also suggests
a "hyperreductive state" around hypoxic mito that
promote relase of Cu from the drug complex
\cite{Hilton_Kysenius_Liddell_Evidence_disrupted_copper_2024}/
pointing to a possible more general mechnism.
The work goes onto suggest possible role in Parkinson's Disease
but does not address AD.
At least one observational study found a 
negative correlation between odds ratio for Parkinson's and copper
intake \cite{Zeng2024}

One recent review on anti-cancer mechanisms of copper dicussed
various ligands and roles for both copper depletion
and overload
\cite{Babak_Ahn_Modulation_Intracellular_Copper_2021}.


 Copper storage diseases and in essence "overdose" are
well known \cite{Fuentealba2003} % this also mentions absorption idiosyncracies
 and a role in cancer is suspected \cite{PMC5412452}
.
% TODO find the other comments for here 
However, see the comments below about complexed copper actually
being an active compound similar to other drugs,
perhaps Pt based for example,  which may kill cancer.
Copper toxicity has been noted to differ between host cell types
and may be reducible, at least in  Long Evans Cinnamon rats, with thiamine or lipoic
acid \cite{ANA:ANA10276}.
Lysyl oxidase activation, the goal of this therapy, is also associated
with cancer spread \cite{PMC5399287}\cite{PMC5413586}\cite{PMC5297697}
. Although it is likely to remodel
possible tumor locations, its role in growth or  metastases
in a clinically relevant situation is currently unresolved
( see for example \cite{PMC3280126}
 or \cite{PMC5103911} and the survival curve in figure 1).
Incidence of liver cancer in Wilson's Disease patients is remarkably low
\cite{PMC4803712} and a discussion of possible treatment effects
\cite{doi:10.1093/qjmed/hcg114} points out that the copper per
se rather than removal is likely to help while also mentioning
differences with iron overload. Indeed, extra copper that prevents
iron overload may be therapeutic as originally intended.


We should note that complexed copper is not equivalent
to copper deficiency as the complex may not be inert.
However, when an ROS generating complex has been observed it  effects were
diminished by antioxidants \cite{PMC4223620}.
This also suggests that copper depletion per se
may not kill cancer cells as much as copper complexes
and that concerns about copper supplements and cancer may not
be significant.

Supplemental copper has been noted to improve
symptoms in one case report including symptoms such as hearing loss \cite{PMID15902551}
attributed to defects in cytochrome C oxidase copper loading
and restore function in mutant yeast \cite{doi:10.1093/hmg/ddu069}
.Cytochrome C oxidase levels in rat hearts were shown to
be related to copper deficiency as early as  1998  \cite{Rossi1998}.
It would be interesting to determine if more problems in dogs
are related to specific mutations in mitochondrial copper handling.
We note again that vitamin K could contribute in similar places
and may be synergistic with copper for connective tissue quality
as well as in eukaryotic mitochondria \cite{Vos1306}\cite{PMC5022102}
.

Two types of excess have been identified as potentially
important to pathogenesis- mineral and antioxidant.
Iron overload copper deficiency was identified early on as
a concern with animals getting high iron diets and generally
free of parasites in stark contrast to the likely situation over
evolutionary time scales. A second type emerged on consideration
of the copper response and cytochrome C oxidase copper loading -
that of antioxidant overload. ROS have generally gained more acceptance
as having physiological roles at low concentrations rather than simply
being a source of damage. Literature related to these experiments
suggests a very specific role in mitochondrial function.
The original concern about antioxidant overload was mostly
confined to vitamin E-K antagonism and it is not
clear how or if these concerns relate. Coupled with empirical
deleterious effects of some antioxidant combinations in clinical trials
( one high profile  example \cite{doi:10.1056/NEJM199605023341802} )
,
it is clear that antioxidant excess should be considered
as a problem with some diets.  The antioxidant paradox
now seems to be gaining acceptance , for example see \cite{PMC4412352}
 and \cite{PMC5021979}

Copper is decidedly pro-angiogenic 
and several studies have shown  effects of copper consumption
increasing tumor growth in animals  while both
chelators and ionophores are being investigated for treatments 
\cite{Chen_Min_Wang_Copper_homeostasis_cuproptosis_2022}.
However, pro-growth and angiogenesis could also be expected
during regeneration which itself may require copper.

Regulation at transcriptional and translation and post-translational
levels is confusing. For example, it has been described in
1998 as \cite{SmithMungo_Kagan_Lysyl_oxidase_Properties_regulation_1998},
\begin{quote}
While enzyme activity levels were decreased in the skin of weanling rats
fed a copper deficient diet, the basal, steady-state levels of LO specific
mRNA or immunodetectable LO protein were not significantly reduced (Rucker
et al., 1996). These results suggest both that the biosynthesis of the enzyme
is not markedly affected by copper deficient diets and that the increasing
percentage of copper-deficient, catalytically compromised enzyme molecules
presumed to accumulate during this dietary treatment remain relatively stable.
Notably, copper-deficient diets significantly reduced cardiac LO activity
and induced cardiac pathology in male but not in female rats (Werman et
al., 1995). 
\end{quote}
or more to the point from the same year,
\cite{Rucker_Kosonen_Clegg_Copper_lysyl_oxidase_1998}
\begin{quote}
Although nutritional copper status does not influence the accumulation of
lysyl oxidase as protein or lysyl oxidase steady state messenger RNA concentrations,
the direct influence of dietary copper on the functional activity of lysyl
oxidase is clear. The hypothesis is based on the possibility that copper
efflux and lysyl oxidase secretion from cells may share a common pathway.
The change in functional activity is most likely the result of posttranslational
processing of lysyl oxidase.

It has been observed to upregulate in the injured
newborn lung
\cite{Zhong_Mahoney_Khatun_Lysyl_oxidase_regulation_2022}
sugesting increased levels may be a response to an insult
rather than a cause of damage. 



In 2001, it was observed that bovine lyxyl oxidase had enzymatic
activity without copper but was less stable
\cite{Tang_Klinman_Catalytic_Function_2001}
although details on reactions catalyzed could not have
been fully explored. 


However, metallization may not be complete
and feedback systems may increase expression to achieve
an activity level. Note too that "crosslinking" is
a variable modification and physiological as well as
pathological crosslinking can occur. 
While "quantity versus quality" will be the subject of
another work, its important to remember that increased
expression of lysyl oxidase genes and more patholoical
crosslinking could occur in the absence of sufficient copper.
Mature functional lysyl oxidase contains an unusual 
 lysine tyrosylquinone (LTQ) which itself is formed in 
a copper dependent process \cite{PMC2749888}.
Depence on multiple tyrosines or tryptophans   can
increase the odss of generating dysfunctional
enzymes which may be inactive or perform unintended functions 
when these amino acids are limited. This theme of amino
acid starvation also appears in concerns about ceruloplasmin
and more generally with aging. 

Lysyl oxidase  expression has been associated with degenerative
mitral valve disease in humans\cite{PMC5541772}.

as well as 2 tyrosines. Independent errors in metallization
will multiple and reduce likelyhood of functional enzyme.  

The blood leveels of ceruloplasmin may correlate well
with copper blood levels but it can vary in quality too. 
A chain  of W and Y  are thought important
for enzyme preservation  with ceruloplasmin containing a chain of
two tyrosines \cite{Tian_Jones_Solomon_Role_Tyrosine_2020}.
As iron accumulation is related to AD, there is a question about
the quality of the circulating ceruloplasmin.  If there is high-infidelity
translation due to W and Y depletion, there is also the question of
how feedback mechanisms control the overall amount.
First is has to metalize right which requires 6 coppers and
6 histidines and then survive with the 2 tyrosines. 
If any components are deficient quantity or quality may suffer.

Copper in these dogs may be beneficial through accumulation
in macrophages and other locations, use by lysyl oxidase to
stiffen trachea and other structural organs, and for
energy production notably by the heart leading to greater

As with most other sites, copper in macrophages can be
considered pathological and attempts may be made
to limit rather than enhance it.
For example, targeting mitochondrial copper with
"rationally" designed metformin dimers

\begin{abstract}
The known roles of copper suggest it is needed to perform
functions that could mitigate several common diseases
yet it  is not currently a trendy supplement for dogs or
humans. Part of the concern with dogs is the variable
genetics and observatins of copper accumulation in the liver
becoming more common. However, with most genetics lacking
a recognized  copper storage disease, copper distribution is
regulated by a complex system that appears to consider
locale based demand as part of the uptake and excretion control 
algorithm.  Such a system may produce bottlenecks leading to
uncommonly large accumulation in an organ such as the liver
while another organ such as the heart is starved.
Surch a situation could occur due to some other nutrient
limitation that fools the feedback mechanisms.
Without knowing the specific bottleneck, the decision
to supplement would be based on the overall benefits
to the starving location versus any harms to the 
accumulating organ. 
This work describes copper supplementation to a group
of dogs without obvious significant harm while 
in some cases coinciding with benefits such as
increased energy or reduced coughing. The "background diet"
is discussed in terms of making extra copper intake useful
to the hosts. While copper interacts with just about everything,
specific interactions with amino acids, B-6, and zinc are
considered in more detail.  
The overall diet may help mitigate two contemporary
issues, hepatic copper accumulation and diet related
DCM, in dogs as well as highlight rrecurring issues
with hidden assumptions and logical fallacies when dealing
with non-obvious regulatory feedback systems. Hopefully
this workd leads to a starting point for 
a diet-related disease mitigation strategy and helps
turn paradoxes into paradigms be elucidating some
feedback mechanisms that may be quite common. 
 
\mjmtolx{
Two contemporary diet related dog health issues,
, hepatitic copper accumulation
and dilated cardiomyopathy, may be symptoms
of the same set of nutrient deficiencies with the latter
reflecting cardiac copper deficiency.
The inability to attack each is probably due to 
unexamined assumptions about cause and effect leading
from diet to clinican outcomes. 
In particular, homeostatic mechanisms 
and roles %  ( sequestering vs activating for example )
may need more attention.  Role may come up
in cause and effect but also in action such as sequestering
or depleting versus activating. This type of role confusion
comes up in the copper literature.  
Local nutrient related feedback signals
may cause more copper uptake but be unable to 
deliver it to the heart where it is needed.
Consideration of homeostatic mechanisms,
feedback loops, is often neglected and that may be the case
in the present condundrum.  
This work describes copper supplementation to a group of dogs
over several years with no robust deletious effect established
although some suspicious observations are discussed.
Bnefits associated with copper supplementation,
in the context of more complete supplementation, include 
reduced coughing likely due to infectious
respiratory disease, collapsed trachea,, or dilated / hypertrophic
heart. 
Copper in these dogs may be beneficial through accumulation
in macrophages and other locations, use by lysyl oxidase to
stiffen trachea and other structural organs, and for
mitochondrial energy production notably by the heart leading to greater
volumetric efficiency and reduced size. 
Particular nutrients that may aid transport out of the liver
would likely be those which enhance ceruloplasmin quantity or quality
or othewise modify copper handling. Tryptophan and tyrosine are
two candidates for limiting copper toxicity  and both were generally
supplemented in this group of dogs. Both amino acids have
unique functions and distribution may be modified by many
factors from GI health to overall food chemistry and
microbial metabolism.  Some works implicating copper
quantity in pathogenesis of these or other conditions
is examined for hidden assumptions. 
Of particular note may be that the mitochondrial copper pools
are regulated by oxidized glutathione suggesting
the possibility that antioxidant overdose could
damage this signal leading to insufficient energy
output.  Another is mistaking adequate blood copper levels as a sign
of overall sufficiency rather than a sacrificial accute phase
response. 
This work may be useful in mitigating these two unrelated
issues.

\section{Introduction  }
Copper is  currently not a trendy supplement
for humans or dogs. However,  known and expected functions
make it a good   match to several possible problems 
motivating an interestt in supplementation  even if contrary
indicators also exist.  
The question of dietary deficiency or excess
has been a topic of controversy for many years and likely
copper intake alone is not the dominant issue but rather
distribution in the body deterined by other dietary components
as well as genetics.
The question of supplementation has to be anwered within the context
of a specific overall diet  and other factors like genetics.
Even if a surplus occurs in one location, the question
remains if there  would be 
a net benefit reducing deficiency in some other place even if 
more local excess occurs.  
Thsis has to be answered in terms of clinical outcomes,
things relevant to the host, rather than lab values.  
The background dietary context for this work has been described
previously
\cite{marchywka-MJM-2021-018-0.50rg}
and the copper supplementations described here is likely
well in excess of background levels in most known natural foods
although its also worth noting that other sources may 
be significant as with water and air exposure 
\cite{Georgopoulos_Wang_Georgopoulos_Assessment_human_exposure_2006} .

One increasingly common concern with dogs is copper associated
hepatitis
\cite{10.1093/tas/txad147}
\cite{PMC10787350}
\cite{Center_Richter_Twedt_time_2021}.
Some noisy association between intake and hepatic copper
content was shown in a small study
\cite{Fieten_HooijerNouwens_Biourge_Association_Dietary_Copper_2012}
but intak  was probably not the major determinant of copper content
.
The causal role of copper in any clinical disease remains unclear. 
One study produced a histogram of liver Cu content (ppm dry weight )
for a few hundred dogs but did not conlucde there was a particular
cutoff level for health vs disease
\cite{Thornburg_Rottinghaus_McGowan_Hepatic_Copper_Concentrations_1990}.
Work continues to focus on concepts of deficiency or
excess even though both may be matters of degree, location,  and context. 
 Deficiency   in commercial dog foods was    suspected years
earlier  \cite{HuberTLa}
while works as early as 2000 suggested supplementation
would be unhelpful\cite{doi:10.1177/104063870001200201}.
A recent work comparing mineral content in groups of commericial
dog foods found some patterns and advised against high copper
foods  
\cite{KUx0119badchar_Biel_Witkowicz_Mineral_heavy_metal_2023}.
Recognized low copper status is  known in humans
and may be related to dietary components such as  
high fructose intake \cite{PMID7825519}. 
Copper deficient liver patients 
may be  notable for
"steatohepatitis, iron overload, malnutrition, and recurrent infections. "
\cite{Yu_Liou_Biggins_Copper_Deficiency_Liver_2019} .
Cppper handling genetic diseases  are well known in dogs 
\cite{PMC6531654} and some concern  about excess intake may be warranted
for specific animals. 


Ideally observation of a pathological copper 
buildup in one location with symptoms of deficiency
in other systems would lead to a search for 
the bottleneck prohibiting a better allocation.
With copper this is quite complicated. 
A number of regulatory systems are known to control
copper levels in different compartments  in healthy mammals.
Uptake regulation is not completely known but response to
dietary or ambient levels is only part of the control
loop in vivo and likely cytosolic sensors exist \cite{PMC6365104}.

Copper related signalling is such that remote signals may exist from the heart
to liver and intestines to make more available
\cite{Kim_Turski_Nose_Cardiac_Copper_Deficiency_Activates_2010}
\cite{xxx_Mechanism_regulation_2010}. In this scenario, local
shortage could induce blood stream or liver excess due to added
inputs with struggling cardiac specific uptake.
A similar feedback scheme 
has been suggested for other nutrients such as tryptophan
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2021-007-.1-table-rg}
and biotin
\cite{marchywka-MJM-2022-010-0.80}
\cite{marchywka-MJM-2021-015-0.50-rg}
.  
CTR1 transport, important for
intestinal uptake  
\cite{Nose_Kim_Thiele_Ctr1_drives_intestinal_copper_2006}
and distribution  
\cite{Lee_Prohaska_Thiele_Essential_role_mammalian_2001}
\cite{PMC9759326}
\cite{PMC34439}
is reduced if some
histidines are mutated in either the C or N terminal tails. 
Intestinal loss of CTR1 causes cardiac hypertrophy
among other issues that are partially correctable with copper supplementation
\cite{Nose_Kim_Thiele_Ctr1_drives_intestinal_copper_2006}
.
This suggests cardiac copper deficiency as an issue for cardiac hypertrophy 
in animals but does not exclude simultaneous excess in the liver. .

Treatment emergent copper deficiency has been observed in 
Bedlington Terriers with an excretion defect 
that clinically resolved with cessation of chelation 
\cite{Seguin_Bunch_Iatrogenic_copper_deficiency_associated_2001}.


One concern in this work relates to "high-infidelity transcription"
or the synthesis of proteins defective at specific amino acid codons
largely due to lack of a required acid, such as histidine,  and 
appropriately charged tRNA 
Normally biliary excretion increases when pathological
amounts of copper begin to accumulate
\cite{Chen_Min_Wang_Copper_homeostasis_cuproptosis_2022}
\cite{Hamza_Gitlin_Hepatic_Copper_Transport_2013} pointing
to defects in excretion as another possible problem.
Other known cause and effect relationships are known. 
Senescent cells may accumulate copper in the absence
of autophagy
\cite{Masaldan_Clatworthy_Gamell_Copper_accumulation_senescent_2018}.
Copper elevation may commit 
cord-blood derived cells  to differentitaion \cite{PMID11849228}
and it may be regulat4ed during myogenic differntiation
\cite{PMC5824686} raisng the possibility that accumulation
is due to confused signalling. 
The major copper transporting protein ceruloplasmin is an 
acute phase protein 
and blood levels may be associated with pathological conditions
\cite{PMID15668644} but a protective role is generally recognized.
As a major transporter of copper out of the liver, 
stresses then could export copper  out of the  liver.
In fact, as substantiated later, it would make sense
for copper to be redeployed from some mitrochondria to the blood
in response to pathogens or trauma. This will lead to hydrogen
peroxide formation and potentially labile  copper both conditions
likely to control infection. 

\mjmtolx{
Other dietary components can impact uptake, signalling,  and 
distribution in many ways. 
The dietary and genetic factors that influence copper 
distribution  and health outcomes are complex and probably not fully known. 
While genetics are highly variable in dogs, some other factors
include many dietary components, GI health,  and signalling stimuli. 

}

At least one source of confusion may be the interaction
of copper nutrition with many other nutrients
with some listed in \mjmrefapp{interactions}.
Competition between Cu, Fe, and Zn was observed in Caco-2
cells \cite{ARREDONDO_MARTINEZ_NUNEZ_Inhibition_iron_2006}.
Iron intake in feed has also been observed to decrease
copper uptake in ruminants 
\cite{Clarkson_Paine_Kendall_Evaluation_solubility_2021} 
and rats
\cite{Lee_Ha_Collins_Dietary_Iron_Intake_2021}
.
One work suggested  iron disrupts copper homeosstasis
independent of uptate
\cite{Ha_Doguer_Collins_Consumption_high_2017}.
Dietary cholesterol appears to distrurb copper homeostasis 
with atherosclerosis thought to involve copper dysregulation
\cite{PMID33661473}
and high fat diets in other species \cite{PMC5167165} are an issue.
Fructose also inhibits relative copper absorption
\cite{ODell_Fructose_mineral_metabolism_1993}.
Zinc is a known inhibitor of cuppoer uptake
and cases of zinc induced copper deficiency in humans
are known\cite{PMC7495772}.
While concerns exist about copper content in dog foods, a
recent survey of some zinc content shous many foods 
contain amount above recommended maxima and few are
low or deficient \cite{PMC8066201}.
Age related absorption problems in people
are known \cite{PMC5133110} and other apparent deficiencies 
could be a consequence of
insufficient B-6 alone \cite{PMID7814236}.
Interestinly, B-6 is added to penicillamine treatment of
Wilson's disease to avoid neurological effects
\cite{PMC3526418}.
\mjmtol{
Since paradoxes are a concern here, its worth noting that pyridoxine
is an inhibitor of PLP and high dosese result in functional B-6
deficiency \cite{Vrolijk_Opperhuizen_Jansen_vitamin_paradox_2017}.
}
% sled dog exercize comment omitted for no good reason to include
Body stores of copper increase with excess tyrisone in the diet
of rats
\cite{Yang_Noda_Kato_Elevated_Intestinal_Absorption_}.
Some reports show specific issues when combinted with vitamin C.
A small trial with copper sulfate indicated kidney problems
result 
\cite{Jiang_Sui_Hong_Combined_Administration_2023}
although alternatives with copper gluconate 
suggested use as food preservative
\cite{Graf_Copper_Ascorbate_1994}
. Dose probably matter among other factors.  


The present work gives details of most of the dietary components
but analysis is largely confined to a select few such as
tryptophan, tyroine, histidine, and vitamin B-6. Its worth
noting that copper is quite reactive and can form 
coompounds with many aromatic rings, nitrogens, sulgurs, or
other common chemical groups.  


GI health and in particular stomach acidity may be important
facotrs in copper uptake but also distribution if other
nutrient deficiencies are created. 
\mjmtolx{Copper uptake may depend on anions such as chloride
at least in some fish 
\cite{Handy_Musonda_Phillips_Mechanisms_Gastrointestinal_Copper_2000}
,suggesting GI chloride per se may require more investigation.
Content in drinking water is variable and may be perceived
by humans depending on factors like pH \cite{Hong_Duncan_Dietrich_Effect_copper_speciation_2010} sugesting it may be perceived by dogs too.
}
Copper solubility is pH dependent \cite{10.1093/chemse/bjl010}
similar to the competing element zinc for which absorption
 has been shown to depend on salt type and
gastric pH \cite{PMID8577018}.
Interaction with food components such as polyphenols is significant
and pH dependent 
\cite{PMC3401972} motivating a larger interest in food interactions
and in particular rings such as in tyrosine. 
Speciation gradients
may be large in the range of possible stomach acid levels.  
A 2021 study did in fact explore copper speciation in simulated
gastic juices with food components such as 
tyrosine and citric acid among others \cite{PMC8441336}.
Impact of GI pH on broiler chicks has been studied due to impact
on nutrition and micrbial populations 
and Cu-Zn antagonism in the digestive system was also observed
\cite{Pang_Applegate_Effects_Dietary_Copper_2007}.

\mjmtol{ put somewhere }
In humans, PPI usage has become common. Empirically thate
may be a tumor protective effect and  there is a suggestion
that  pH 6 encourages cancer progression
versus pH 8
\cite{PMC7085403}
yet alkaline stomach pH is observed is commonly observed
in gastric carcinoma
\cite{10.1007/978-4-431-68246-2_26}.
Probably the dominant effect on tumors is unrelated to ambient
pH although increased pH may reduce nutrient
accumulation by many cells. An absolute apoptosis rate
at near neutral pH is probably not indicative of the
overall fitness in the stomach. 




This work describes inclusion of copper into a set
of supplements for dogs with different conditions and unknown genetics 
showing generally beneficial results  or at least
no obvious harm with added copper.
This result is in contrast to some of the popular expactations
cited above.
A descrepancy between expectations and outcome 
of this type seems to be common in medicine
and biology so understanding the causes of that
in this partciular case may help optimize
dog supplements and avoid delays in understanding the
limitations of data and theory  to design 
therapeutic interventions.  
Interpretation of the copper literature is limited by 
unqestioned assumptions and logidcal fallacies 
that are quite common.  Some types of problems
are listed in  \mjmrefapp{errors}.
A 2010 work suggested that high copper and iron intake were
particularly dangerous in older people observing that
one study concluded high intake of both was assoicated with increased cognitive
decline 
\cite{Brewer_Risks_Copper_2010}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Part of the reluctance to supplement "high" copper doses
is the accumulation in the livers of some dogs but
relation to any clinical disease is not clear. This
may be similar to amyloid beta in Alzheimer's
Disease and pointing to the need to understand cause
and effect before an all out attack on one molecular
entity.  

A recent example may be the identification of amyloid
beta as a nominally protective substance
\cite{Yu_Wu_Amyloid_upbeta_double_2021}
\cite{PMID35673950}
 instead of
the cause of Alzheimer's pathology and target
for intervention. 
That state of affairs is well documented
in the works
that hint at it unravelling\cite{PMID37833948}  such as a 2002 work
suggesting that  "tauists" and "baptists" could 'shake hands"
and look for other causes \cite{PMID11801334}.
Interestingly, related to copper,
is the emerging role of lysyl oxidase in Alzheimer's
as a possible target 
where it associates with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and
is thought to be a drug target 
\cite{Kelly_Sharp_Thomas_Targeting_lysyl_oxidase_2023}
\cite{PMC11042178}. However,  upregulation would have to be
suspected as a part of regeneration attempting to fix
degeneration. 
Previously, heartworm positive dogs had been given
significant amounts of vitamin K
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2021-003-v0.50rg}
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2019-001-.1li}
 although severe
case may be treated with anitcoagulants. In thise
case, it may not be clear that vitamin K effects clot
quality and consequently may limite pathological quantities
allowing for beneficial clots to form. 

This work illustrates that empirically deficiency
may be more common in some groups of dogs than excess
in that supplementation, in the context of the rest of the 
diet,  improves apparent health.
If that hypothesis can be shown to be more generally
true, the coppper literature may illustrate some common
fallacies and errors common to biology related
literature and likely other genres involving complicated
systems. 
However copper intake issues are resolved, the complexity of
copper handling may make it a good topic to understand larger
issues in system identification. 



However, the empirical data and known theory or
biological pathways don't estalish a causal role
for excessive intake of copper as a problem in most cases.
Rather, other nutrients may be lacking to properly
deploy existing copper reources and likely other
things. In the particular case of copper accumulation
in the liver, its important to note that import and
export are controlled by different things. 
While import appears to be controlled by diet and
remote signals from the heart and binding
to albumin, export may be
limited by ceruloplasmin and excretion.

Emerging mechanisms such as extracellular veiscles 
\cite{Bellingham_Guo_Hill_secret_life_2015} suggest
that uncharacterized mechanisms of metal homeostasis
exist.


A 2016 study in mice suggested adding copper to water was
worse than adding it to food and supplementation at 6,15, and 30 ppm
with increases in soluble abeta and decreased growth rate and
GSH/SOD activity
\cite{Wu_Han_Gong_effect_copper_2016}.
With a high dose of about 100 micrgograms/day ( from CuSO4) and
a body weight of about 30grams, the dose was about 3.3mg/kg.


Interestingly, 3 amino acids, the ringed "WHY" trinity
( tryptophan, histidine, and tyrosine ) seem to be
the most important. Notably tyrosine protexts ceruloplasmin
and 6 histidines, one for each copper, are required for
a functional enzyme. Mistranslation due to insufficiency
will be amplified byt the higher power if all need to be right. 
There is some indication that "diseases of old age" 
are at least partially medicated by sarcopenia,
most reecently atrial fibrillation
\cite{PMID38739369}
consistent with earlier ideas linking age to
amino acid staration
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2021-007-.1-table-rg}
.
Interestingly, Scavenger Rceptor BI contains 8 highly
conserved tryptophans
\cite{Holme_Miller_Nicholson_Tryptophan_Critical_2016}
which appear important for cholesterol transport
suggesting trp deficiency will slow down its translation
or create many imperefect receptors. 
So, deficiency of these amino acids may produce broad 
non-specific problems that appear to be common
in intractable diseases often associated with old age. 

Copper status may help unify other unresolved issues
in dog health. 
More recently, diet associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
has also become a concern.
Hypothyroidism has been a topic in human health for a while
now and has occured in several dogs here. Interestinly,
that too may be related to copper defieincy.


A 2021 work focused on similar systems by modelling the
effect of amino acids and copper on antobody quality in 
a production setting 
\cite{PMID32875683},
\begin{quote}
{Specifically, copper has a significant, positive effect on titer and a
significant, negative effect on lactatea phenomenon consistently observed
in other CHO cell culture processes.{[}12, 13, 23, 24{]} A plausible explanation
is that the increased copper level is known to drive lactate consumption.
Copper deficiency reduces cytochrome c oxidase activity, limiting the ability
of cells to produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. As a result, cells
switch to aerobic glycolysis to generate ATP, causing increased lactate
production, which affects other metabolic processes.{[}12, 23{]}}
\end{quote}


Given that many diseased state can be caused by low copper,
and accumlation in some does does not equate to excessive
intake in thse dogs, possible benefits of copper were considered.

This work describes in more detail the theoretical and empirical
motivation to consider copper supplementation carefully
as part of a lrger supplementation progam. 
The most interesting dogs' stories are presnted and discussed
in term of the effect of copper and explanation of
differences between expectations and outcomes.  



\section{  Diseases of Interest }

The known roles of copper include pathways and functions that
would seem important for many diseases that are common in dogs.
The present works relies mostly on 'cough" and thyroid related
symptoms ( coat quality, weight distribution, energy level etc).
Cough has many possible origins as discussed previously
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2019-001-.1rg}.  Among these are
respiratory infection or irritation, collapsed trachea, heart failure,
and CNS stimulation. Infection related cough is well known due
to direct irriation. Collapsed trachea may cause a cough on either
inhalation or exhalation with a distinct honking sound.  
Heart failure may initiate fluid build up in the lungs and
other sources of bulk such as a tumor may cause irritation. 
With these source in mind, it is not difficult to find
pathways and locations that require copper for proper functioning.
These have been tabulatedin in \mjmreftab{causes}
along with time scales for the response to reflect changes in 
copper intake. In most cases the distribution is very broad
an non-specific symptoms may be expected. For example,
mitochondria are eveywhere although the heart may be
the first to show symptoms of deficiency. Its also 
important to note that cough monitoring is not
going to be monotonic with improvement as increased
energy may occur quickly resulting in more coughing
until trachea and heart can remodel.

Copper homeostasis is a much larger issue including in human
health with regard to such unresolved diseases as 
Alzheimer's where the decades of work on amyloid beta
is becoming more clearly futile. 


In humans lysyl oxidase is sometimes discussed as
a drug target as its quantity seems to increase in pathological
situations. 
This may suggest that additional copper would not likely
help. 




To help with this apparent conundrum, this work describes
variable copper supplementation to a group of dogs
over several years including one pregnant pit bull with
uterine fibroids. Generally beneficial results 
were associated with copper supplementation in the context
of broader rationally designed supplements.
Apparent benefits to a group of puppies included infection 
control. Additional respiratory infections were
thought to be modulated in older dogs described
here as Cookie( AKA Mixie ) and Trixie. It may have
reduced transmission to the larger group in the latter case.
Also an association with likely non-infectious coughing
was seen in the case of Happy. 

Given the varied canine genetics and known copper related
diseases, vigiliance for adverse reactions was maintained
but to date only questionable events, such as reduced
appetite, remain. 

Copper and vitamin K have both seen literature suggesting
a role for liver health under some conditions. Vitamin K is
note worthy because of many efforts to antagonitze
its effects similar to the present  concerns with copper. 

 
These cases are described in more detail with the hope of
sorting out cause and effect between diet and clinical
outcomes as fixation on one nutrient at  a time may not
be productive. 


The original motivation for copper was based on notions
similar to the table below which reflects current
thinking based on results presented here. 



\section{Cases and Observations}

\mjmdogsone

A series of rescue dogs were fed food and vitamin supplements
in addition to commercial kibble products. Diet and outcomes
were recorded  in MUQED format
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2020-004-.012rg} immediately
after feeding.
While most supplements and medicines were recorded 
in sufficient detail to reproduce, the meal or snack   
most dogs received additional meals of commercial dog food
and unfortuntately uncontrolled scraps or treats while others
routinely ate toys or yard debris. However, some 
results appear to relate to the vitamin mix and notably
inclusion of  copper. Total calorie intake is not reflected in
the data although some details of the products are indicated
in the MUQED data ( see Supplementary Information ).   
In paricular normalization of the "dinner" amounts is variable
between dogs.

Some of the discussion will also reference unpublised notes
on "Little Man" who was given copper and other 
nutrients before the MUQED system was operating.

Many of the dogs in this setting have had either symptoms
that could be due to hypothyroidism or overt lab confirmed
low thyronid hormone levels. As iodine intake flucuated 
wildly, it is included in some of the graphs as 
a putative factor confounding inferences about copper. 
The premise of this work is that the total diet is
a "confounding factor" and readers are encouraged to check
the MUQED data for other patterns. 

Generally copper dosing was rotated leading to high doses
some days with none on intervening days. 
A hard upper limit of
3mg/kg body weight of supplemental copper per day was maintained  based 
on quoted NOAEL's from an  
original source dated  1972 \cite{NAP9782}.
All of the dogs currently living here received increased copper
shortly after the arrival of Trixie due to apparent
spread of coughing. Trixie was later treated with Clavamox
leading to cure suggesting indeed an infectious cause existed. 
Some of the dogs, notably Happy and Rocky, had varying cough levels
previously as described below.

\label{tab:dogs}
\end{table}

\subsection{Cookie or Mixie}

\mjmmixiecu

Arrived with diagnosed respiratory infection and prescribed azithromycin.
Copper and other nutirents were added and eventually infection
resolved well. Contribution of any nutrient is unknown but recovery
seemed uneventful.

\subsection{Brownie and puppies}

\mjmbrowniecu

Brownie was the subject of a prior work 
where ner uneventful pregnancy was notable
for vitamin K consumption while heartworm posivite
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2021-003-v0.50rg}. 
Subsequent to that work, her abdominal tumor
was removed and diagnosed as fibroid. 
Briefly, 
Brownie was determined to be pregnant shortly after arrival
. Her  heartworm
was  treated with Diroban after weaning  and fibroids
removed 2021-11-15 well after the puppies were gone. She was
unevntful until being doganosed with cancer and killed
2023-02-22. Prior to her diganosis, she was observed to 
cough occasionally for no obvious reason and appeared to
have some movement issues. X-ray confirmed tumours likely
responsible for both problems.   

Her copper supplementation was fairly minimal but given her
overall state of health and pregnancy she may be
an interesting case for context. 


\subsection{Happy}

\mjmhappycu
Happy was also the subject of two prior works.
Initially her heartworm recovery was described
with vitamin K and other supplements
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2019-001-.1li}
followed by an unusual episode which resulted in some
investigation of possible role of vitamins B-2 and B-3
in her health
\cite{marchywka-MJM-2022-009-0.50rg}
.
To summarize, Happy arrived heartworm positive coughing to varying degrees.
She was treaed with a slow kill approach including ivermectin
and doxycycline as previously described. She later was acting
sick but appeared to recover well with B vitamin supplements.
Her coughing never returned to the very low levels
seen after heartworm recovery until copper doses were increased
with elimination of any zinc and care with tryptophan.
As copper was increased due to widespread coughing after Trixie's
arrival, her cough was noted to decrease.
Often her excited cough appeared to be a honk on exhale suggestive of
trachea collapse. She also would cough early in the morning
when curled up. 
As outlined in the introductiory material, it was later realized 
that earlier conserns about aromatic amino acids could be
due to simple excitability rather than any disease worsening.
This most recent effort considered some coughing increase normal
and now she seems to have reduced coughing, good energy level,
and maybe some  aromatic amino acid sensitivity. 
Also since starting the increased copper she does not appear to
have disruptive itching around her tail area. Currently
she is coughing when excited but that is with significant
aromatic supplementation which appears to be making her more
excitable.  

\subsection{Trixie}

\mjmtrixiecu

Trixie began coughing shortly after arrival and was
very low energy. Many other dogs began to cough or
hack suggesting that she brought a communicable infectious
disease. Nutrient mix was modified to add more copper and
most dogs coughing returned to normal quanity and qualitiy
although her's did not entirely resolve. Copper stopped for a couple
day ( I was gone ) and owner took he to the vet as she
began coughing more. Clavamox was prescribed and her coughing
stopped within a few days. Her energy level has improved
but she did not  run until 2024-05-02 ( 19845 ) .  

\subsection{Rocky}

\mjmrockycu

\mjmrockyi

Rocky will hopefully be the subject of another work as
he responded significantly to iodine and sodium benzoate
which was attributed to, but never lab confirmed, low
thyroid output. His "plastic" body type changed into
a more normal "flexible" type and he began to feel like 
the other dogs when picked up rather than stiff.
The addition of copper may have reduced his morning cough
but he continued to have apparent congestion after eating
sometimes breathing through his mouth and sneezing.
Most recently he had notable muscle tone which had been lacking.
His overall activity increased but that may be due to social factors
such as feeding ritual. 


A recent study on rats fed benzoate demonstrated
some insignificant indication of increased T4 and decreased
TSH which the authors summarize as,
\cite{TURNBULL2021104897}
,
\begin{quote}
Minor variations in T4 and TSH levels were not considered treatment-related because they were not noted in a dose responsive manner, were not generally statistically significant, or were observed in a direction that would be generally not be considered toxicologically relevant. These minor variations also fell within the range of levels noted for historical controls."
\end{quote}

If there is a beneficial effect, it likely depends on many factors
such as overall diet and may vary across species.





\subsection{Annie}

\mjmanniecu

Annie probably showed the clearest improvement
coincident with increased copper ( and a few other components
described below). 
Annie arrived in generally good condition although 
seemed old for stated age of 6 years. She generally ate well
but had some limitations in sight and hearing. She
seemed to get skin or paw infections easily.
She began to sleep excessively 
and a  special copper snack was started on 2024-05-01 ( 19844).
This consited of 2mg of copper along with sodium benzoate, KCl,
and B-6 in chicken broth which was more readily accepted than the 
full snacks for everyone else. 
As these other components had been quite common they were not
considered significant although the sodium benzoate had also been 
stopped earlier. 
Lost vigor suddently regained in a few days
and seemed restored to her more typical self by
 2024-05-05 ( 10948 ).
 % of 2mg cu. 
Her exercise interest improved and she walked and cried
with good energy.

\label{tab:hershey}
\end{table}

Hershey quickly demonstrated several problems not long after arrival.
He had problems with his fur, digestion, and coughing while ultimately
being diagnosed with heart failure and bladder stones.
During his time here, his diet was varied and he was observed
for overall eating and bahvior with specific interest in 
coughing and ability to make it up a short flight of steps
from the backyard to the deck. Again, the notes were not sufficient
to fully captures the dynamics of his condition but some representative
ones have been edited into the above list. Some correspondence with
copper intake is noted. In the last few days of his life, he
would pass out and quickly regain consciousness until one day 
he did not recover presumably due to heart failure. 
As many initial features could be rationalized as related to thyroid output,
his iodine intake was elevated. 

\subsection{Miscellaneous Observations}
Rocky seemed to do better but had  also been responding
to benzoate and iodine. 

In initial attempts to formulate a vitamin mix,
copper was added but no zinc. There was some possible
feeding hesitance that went away when zinc was added.
However a causal link was not established although 
copper was moderated afterwards. Annie may lose
some appetite with excessive copper. However, a
causal link was not eastablished. 

In a quick review of blood tests, 
chloride tended to be low and bicarbonate high.


\section{Discussion }


Copper supplementation averaging around .2 to as high 
as .8 mg/kgBW/day appeared beneficial in this group of
dogs as symptom improvement often followed weeks of dosing.
Several suspicious observations were noted but nothing
robustly correlated with copper intake. 
As some symptoms such as coughing are the product
of many factors, interpretation is difficult during the 
initial response phases. Most notably, increased general
energy may increase coughing in the presence of a weak
of collapsed trachea or with some heart conditions which
may take longer to mitigate and achieve  more complete  
resolution. Another difficulty is  due to pulxed dosing.
This was chosen to allow rotoation of various
nutrients and make it easier to see short term effects
of comparatively high doses. However, it did require 
that time series be averaged  for analysis.
Happy's copper intake dropped much lower than normal
preceeding a period of excessive coughing. It was only
after copper was started due to a respiratory infection
that the data were examined more carefully and the pattern
noted. Ideally the filtering would be a lagging average
weighted to some suspected biological parameters but
even uniform moving average was useful.   

Pulmonary hypertension may be controlled by serotonin
\cite{PMID27927914} and therefore tryptophan intake. 

Reconciliation with various concerns and failures
felies on the complex interaction with other dietary componets
which may be important over a large range of genetis. 
Copper was just one of many nutrients explored and
it requires some of these for proper handling.
Any optimization strategy would need to conintually
be finding the performance limiting nutrient
in turn as each is tweaked. 

Copper was considered to be important early but despite
some successes was lost in the shuffle. While the conditions
for benehficial usage remain unknown, several suspects
can be identified. Histidine addition was the most
obviously correlated with increased
alertness, animation, and aggression although there
may have been some expectation bias considering increased
histamine contributint to these states. These responses
could increase coughing leading to the erroneous
conclusions it was making something worse.    


Several likely benefits of copper suypplementation were observed
but no clear robust clinical symptoms got worse.
This is contrary to some indications from populat concerns
about excessive copper in commercial dog foods. 
Copper use requires uptake and transportation to 
various targets. Transport out of the liver can be hindered
for reasons such as ceruloplasmin defects.

Coughing and other subjective signs were often used
to monitor progress and notes were not always sufficient.
Coughing as described before can be produced by many
causes. Here, we were concerned mostly with infection,
trachea collapse, and heart enlargement. Honking
related to trachea collapse may be more common when the
dog is excited. In this case, improving "energy" may
produce more coughing even though the dog is largely
healthier but the heart is still large or trachea
still soft. This is further complicated with additions
of vitamins that tend to promote alertness as was 
observed with histidine ( indeed there was some concern
about aggression when initiating it ). This may not
have been fully appreciated early on.  


B-6 deficiency has been linked to excess copper excretion \cite{PMID7814236}
possibly making copper a secondary excretion issue
rather than a primary absorption problem. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% cutoff

ver a broad range of genetics, its likely that copper intake
can be raised as long as other nutirents are also given
to handle the copper beneficially.
Candidate nutrients include tryrosine and tryptophan.


\section{Limitations}
While the other components were mentioned as important,
it needs to be reiterated that the 
the other snack components could have effected copper handling
significantly and supplementation with another diet lacking
these components may not be beneficiail but copper restriction
may not be either. Most food ingredient interact with matals 
to varying degrees and this notably contained citric acid
and spinach along with amino acids. 

The residential setting made it difficult to control or monitor
all of the factors which could effect health. Besides the main
kibble meals not being recorded for some dogs, intake of food
and foriegn objects was common and unpredictable. 
Supplement quantities were often measured by volume using kitchen
utensils known to be poorly calibrated. 
Completely unknown experiences or factors may be involved in their
subjective behaviors.  Cigarette smoke exposure was common
but variable.
As is always the case, despite MUQED's ability to keep strcutured
outcome notes on things like cough, the resulting outcome
data was very sparse and relies on memory in some cases.
The lesson remains that notes and data always need to be
more complete. 



\section{Conclusions}
Copper has to be suspected of being important in dogs for 
functions that likely
include strengthening  of structural elements such as the trachea,
volumetric energy effeiciency of the heart, and infection control.
In the GI tract, it may moderate pathogenic phenotypes and
change community structure of microbiome. 
Accumulation in the liver may reflect export problems
rather than too much intake as signalling exists to
regulate uptake and disposal. Defects may be due to other nutrients
and particularly anything that interfers with ceruloplasmin 
synthesis or quality. 

Internal transport and uptake however may both rely on 
GI defects which limit nutrient avialbility. Low stomach
acid may be one common problem. 

Zinc excess may also interfer with copper
deployment.
Dog genetics are varied and specifics likely vary too.
Similar considerations may apply to humans. 

Liver pathology that includes atypical amounts of copper
may not reflect excess dietary intake but some other problem
that needs to be fixed.

\section{ Statement of Conflicts }
 No specific funding was used in this effort and there are no relationships
with others that could create a conflict of interest. I would like to develop
these ideas further and have obvious bias towards making them appear 
successful. Barbara Cade, the dog owner, has worked in the pet food industry
but this does not likely create a conflict. We have no interest in the
makers of any of the products named in this work.

\section{About the Authors and Facility}
This work was performed at a dog rescue run by Barbara Cade and
housed in rural Georgia.  The author of this report 
,Mike Marchywka,
has a background in electrical engineering and 
has done extensive research using free online literature sources.  
I hope to find additional people interested in critically 
examining the results and verify that they can be reproduced
effectively to treat other dogs.

\section{Some Common Logical Fallacies and Misdirections}
\label{appendix:errors}

The analysis errors that confuse the problem with the
solution may be catagorized in a number of way but
consider the following possibilities,  

\newcommand{\myitem}[2]{\item {\bf #1 : } #2 \par}
\begin{enumerate}
\myitem{supply v demand}{ An excess quantity is not inherently due to either supply or demand }
\myitem{false dichotomy}{ good and evil  }
\myitem{non-monotonic curves }{ \mjmquote{ show me a monotonic dose response curve and I'll show you a fool } }
\myitem{hidden interaction }{ The observed result requires some interaction partners  }
\myitem{X is a Y   }{ Role confusion leads to more untested assumptions.  }
\myitem{only relies on  empirical obervations  }{ no cuase and effect stablished   }
\myitem{irnores empirical obervations  }{ "sanity  check " Theory based on incomplete system topology needs to be consistent with empirical observations  }
\myitem{irnores empirical obervations  }{ Theory based on incomplete system topology needs to be consistent with empirical observations  }
\myitem{other state variables }{ Hidden variables include a limting nutrient that is needed to beneficially use the entity under test.   }
\myitem{regulatory landscape }{ As life is generally robust control systems have evolved but may have non-obvious failure modes. }
\myitem{trying harder  }{ If a prefered response is frustrated in attaining a survival relevant goal, there may be signals to try a less orderly response more vigorously. The disorganized response can be suppressed by enabling the effective one.  }
\myitem{narrow corridor }{  Given host-other evolution, you could expect dose response curves with many features but more likely a tight tolerance means that the approach is missing something more robust.  }
\end{enumerate}

Copper is  not currently a trendy supplement
for humans or dogs.
This may be partially due to  deficiency being  a neglected  diagnosis  by
physicians 
\cite{PMC10733163}
\cite{Fong_Vij_Vijayan_Copper_deficiency_important_2007}
\cite{Wahab_Mushtaq_Borak_Zincinduced_copper_deficiency_sideroblastic_2020}
\cite{Urtiaga_Terrero_Malumbres_Myelopathy_secondary_copper_2018}
\cite{Goez_Jacob_Fealey_Unusual_Presentation_2011}
\cite{Abdolmohammadi_Sharma_Copper_Deficiency_Forgotten_2011}
.
In dogs however a specific issue with liver copper accumulation has
been noted. 
An expert consensus statement on hepatitis in dogs suggested 
an increased incidence  that conincided with a change in copper supplementation
premix in commercial dog foods \cite{PMC6524396} pointing
to increased intake as a cause. 
However,  known and expected functions
make it a good   match to several possible problems 
motivating an interestt in supplementation  even if contrary
indicators also exist.  
In fact, isolated authors do sometimes  point to it as a major
cause of diseases such as  heart disease
\cite{DiNicolantonioe000784}
\cite{PMC8838622}
and copper containing or eluting stents have been investigated 
since 2017
\cite{Jin_Qi_Zhang_Evaluation_promoting_effect_2017}
.
Copper appears to be of recognized importance in dogs
and the question of dietary deficiency or excess  
has been a topic of controversy for many years.  Its is  likely
that copper intake alone is not the dominant issue but rather
distribution in the body deterined by singalling, other dietary components
, and genetics.
The question of supplementation has to be answered within the context
of a specific overall diet  as well as recognized  factors including genetics.
If an unusually high concentration if measured  in one location, the question
remains if there  would be 
a net benefit reducing deficiency in some other place even if 
more local excess occurs.  
Thsis has to be answered in terms of clinical outcomes,
things relevant to the host, rather than lab values.  
Even in the case of known genetic diseases,
copper removal to improve liver values may create clinical
copper deficiency. 
Treatment emergent copper deficiency has been observed in 
a Bedlington Terrier with an excretion defect 
that clinically resolved with cessation of chelation 
\cite{Seguin_Bunch_Iatrogenic_copper_deficiency_associated_2001}.
} % \mjmintro



\newcommand{\mjmresolve}
{
A couple of papers from 1964 illustrate the problem in simple
terms. Initially turkeys were fed either a natural or purified
diet with varying copper levels demonstrating toxicity in the
purified diet but only minor issues combined with the natural diet
\cite{Waibel_Snetsinger_Ball_Variation_Tolerance_1964}.ZZ
A follow up work suggested the purified diet could be safe
with copper but considered vitamin A, D, and zinc 
additions and noted an off odor in high copper feed
\cite{Supplee_Observations_Effect_1964}. The possibility of
vitamin depletion as well as formation of toxics could
be factors but also as discussed later overall absorption.
Simple things can matter a lot for many reasons. 



The importance of overall diet chemistry for copper
availability was recently made for poultry
\cite{Wu_Tan_Shi_vitro_bioaccessibility_2024}.
Ideally the optimal fate of all consumed nutrients  
could be identified and manipulated  with  dietary composition.
This work includes consideration of 
a background dietary context including real foods
and controlled supplements  that  has been described
previously
\cite{marchywka-MJM-2021-018-0.50rg}
. This diet was further refined by consideration of the itneractions
described herein.
The copper supplementations described here, about .3mg/kgBW/day ,  is likely
well in excess of background levels in most known natural diets  
although its also worth noting that other sources may 
be accidentally significant as with water and air exposure 
\cite{Georgopoulos_Wang_Georgopoulos_Assessment_human_exposure_2006}.
\mjmtolx{
A 2016 study in mice suggested adding copper to water was
"worse" than adding it to food and supplementation at 6,15, and 30 ppm
with increases in soluble abeta and decreased growth rate and
GSH/SOD activity
\cite{Wu_Han_Gong_effect_copper_2016}.
With a high dose of about 100 micrgograms/day ( from CuSO4) and
a body weight of about 30grams, the dose was about 3.3mg/kg or
about 10 times higher than considered here.

One increasingly common concern with dogs is copper associated
hepatitis
\cite{10.1093/tas/txad147}
\cite{PMC10787350}
\cite{Center_Richter_Twedt_time_2021}.
Cppper handling genetic diseases  are well known in dogs 
\cite{PMC6531654} and some concern  about excess intake may be warranted
for specific animals. 
Some noisy association between intake and hepatic copper
content was shown in a small study
\cite{Fieten_HooijerNouwens_Biourge_Association_Dietary_Copper_2012}
but copper intake  may not be the major determinant of copper content
.
The causal role of copper "excess"  in any clinical disease remains unclear. 
One study produced a histogram of liver Cu content (ppm dry weight )
for a few hundred dogs but did not conlucde there was a particular
cutoff level for health vs disease
\cite{Thornburg_Rottinghaus_McGowan_Hepatic_Copper_Concentrations_1990}.
Work continues to focus on concepts of deficiency or
excess even though both may be matters of degree, location,  and context. 
 Deficiency   in commercial dog foods was    suspected years
earlier  \cite{HuberTLa}
while works as early as 2000 suggested supplementation
would be unhelpful\cite{doi:10.1177/104063870001200201}.
A recent work comparing mineral content in groups of commericial
dog foods found some patterns and advised against high copper
foods  
\cite{KUx0119badchar_Biel_Witkowicz_Mineral_heavy_metal_2023}.
One reason for liver copper accumulation known since at least
2011 is iron deficiency 
\cite{Ranganathan_Lu_Jiang_Serum_ceruloplasmin_protein_expression_2011}.
A 1997 study found riboflavin deficiency reduced heart and liver iron
while increasing copper content
\cite{Chen1997} and so other nutrients could still be responsible.

Ideally observation of a pathological copper 
buildup in one location with symptoms of deficiency
in other systems would lead to a search for 
the bottleneck prohibiting a better allocation.
% which may include excretion or controlled uptake.
With copper this is quite complicated as 
a number of regulatory systems are known to control
copper levels in different compartments  in healthy mammals.
Uptake regulation is not completely known but response to
dietary or ambient levels is only part of the control
loop in vivo. It is  likely cytosolic sensors exist \cite{PMC6365104}
to monitor cell contents but more global mechanisms appear to 
operate too.

It turns out that copper related signalling is such that remote 
signals may exist from the heart
to liver and intestines to make more available
\cite{Kim_Turski_Nose_Cardiac_Copper_Deficiency_Activates_2010}
\cite{xxx_Mechanism_regulation_2010}. In this scenario, local
shortage in the heart could induce blood stream or liver excess 
due to added
uptake with attempted but failed   cardiac specific delivery.
A similarly confusing  feedback scheme 
has been suggested for other nutrients such as tryptophan
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2021-007-.1-table-rg}
and biotin
\cite{marchywka-MJM-2022-010-0.80}
\cite{marchywka-MJM-2021-015-0.50-rg}
.  Feedback  regulatory systems, as with genes more generally,  are likely 
selected by evolution but that need not make them simple
or  completely robust to defects in the control loop.
One recurring source of defects to consider is  high-infidelity
translation or a specific pattern of translational defects likely related
to the charge state of tRNA for paricularly problematic
amino acids.   
Motivation for the current work comes from observations on
conditional KO or mutational diseases relevant to copper handling. 
For example, copper transporter CTR1 , important for
intestinal uptake  
\cite{Nose_Kim_Thiele_Ctr1_drives_intestinal_copper_2006}
and distribution  
\cite{Lee_Prohaska_Thiele_Essential_role_mammalian_2001}
\cite{PMC9759326}
\cite{PMC34439}
has  reduced function  if some
histidines are mutated in either the C or N terminal tails. 
Intestinal loss of CTR1 causes cardiac hypertrophy
among other issues that are partially correctable with copper supplementation
\cite{Nose_Kim_Thiele_Ctr1_drives_intestinal_copper_2006}
This suggests cardiac copper deficiency, possibly due to histidine 
deficiency,  can contribute to  cardiac hypertrophy 
in animals.  However, if uptake and accumulation occurs
while the heart is deficient this effect,  combined
with other mechanisms,   does not exclude simultaneous excess in the liver.
%"Jigh-infidelity transcription" or the synthesis of proteins defective at specific amino acid codons largely due to lack of a required acid, such as histidine,  and appropriately charged tRNA 


Even with excessive intake, in most genetics
 biliary excretion increases when "pathological"
amounts of copper begin to accumulate
\cite{Chen_Min_Wang_Copper_homeostasis_cuproptosis_2022}
\cite{Hamza_Gitlin_Hepatic_Copper_Transport_2013} pointing
to defects in excretion as another possible problem.
However, many cuase and effect relationships or
control paths exist allowing other factors to control
local copper concentrations.  
Senescent cells may accumulate copper in the absence
of autophagy
\cite{Masaldan_Clatworthy_Gamell_Copper_accumulation_senescent_2018}.
Copper elevation may commit 
cord-blood derived cells  to differentitaion \cite{PMID11849228}
and it may be regulat4ed during myogenic differntiation
\cite{PMC5824686} raisng the possibility that accumulation
is due to confused signalling. 
The major copper transporting protein ceruloplasmin is an 
acute phase protein 
and blood levels may be associated with pathological conditions
\cite{PMID15668644} but a protective role is generally recognized.
As a major transporter of copper out of the liver, 
stresses then could export copper  out of the  liver.
In fact, as substantiated later, it would make sense
for copper to be redeployed from some mitrochondria to the blood
in response to pathogens or trauma. This will lead to hydrogen
peroxide formation and potentially anti-pathogen copper both conditions
likely to control infection. 
Emerging mechanisms such as extracellular veiscles 
\cite{Bellingham_Guo_Hill_secret_life_2015} suggest
that uncharacterized mechanisms of metal homeostasis
exist.

This work will tend to support the idea of "listening to the heart"
or assuming copper retention is due to need by the heart 
even if some accumulates in the liver. 

\mjmtol{ An interesting recent work suggests
that iron accumulation in aortic valve calcification
is a compensatory response to global iron deficiency
\cite{PMID39728514}. 
It remains to be seen if this is "compensatory hoarding" favoring the
heart but that does have to be considered as a possibility.
}



\mjmtolx{
Other dietary components can impact uptake, signalling,  and 
distribution in many ways. 
The dietary and genetic factors that influence copper 
distribution  and health outcomes are complex and probably not fully known. 
While genetics are highly variable in dogs, some other factors
include many dietary components, GI health,  and signalling stimuli.

Copper is used in several important location and a reasonably
complete snapshot of copper sufficiency would in general
be a vector. Easily accesible values such as blood levels
are more responsive to acute pathological situations than
overall body total copper. As details are unknown, a colloquial
analogy may be trying to infer adequacy of military hardware
from measuring the amount on civilian roads. 

There is a recurring problem using blood levels of some thing to indicate
excess or deficiency even though most blood components are
regulated or influenced by specific factor having nothing
to do with overall sufficiency. In the case of copper,
ceruloplasmin usually dominates blood copper and it is
regarded as an acute phase protein causing blood levels 
to elevate in resposne to various stresses. 
Recently some body of work has suggested that macrophage
lysosome may also regulate overll metal distribution
\cite{10.1039/c6mt00058d} a location that would be expected to
respond to many stimuli. 

This work will try to evaluate the goodness of copper supplementation
based on things relevant to the host's  "quality of life"
or clinical outcomes.
One simple thing that is influenced by  copper is coughing.
%There is an attempt to distinguish symptoms or biomarkers  from disease although the
%two may themselves be ambiguous. The main diagnostic here is coughing.
This is certainly relevant to the host and would hvae to be considered
an easily observable a clinical outcome. 
However, the underlying diseases that provokes the
cough may not monotonically correspond to coughins features.  
Coughing may be more common during excitement which does not
occur with a feeling of lethargy common in disease.
Careful consideration of the diseases and locations in the following
section
suggests that disease and this symptom
could decouple with copper supplementation. That is, coughing may 
increase with  arousal state
and it is thought that initially  copper may increase overall 
energy levels and therfore  coughing frequency if another problem
like heart disease or collapsed trachea also exists.
However, at least one pathological state
may be improved with anticipation that another pathology will
recover but more slowly leading to later coughing reduction as more
pathological states resolve.

\newcommand{\mjmall}
{
One problem making reproducible statements about 
copper supplementation may be the interaction
of copper compounds with  almost everything else.
Literature exists on some intreractions but the versaility
of copper probably makes a copmlete list intractable.
Some of the 'usual suspects" are listed in \mjmrefapp{interactions}
merely to indicate a lot of what is left out of the current analysis.

Thie confusion begins in the GI tract with chemisty ranging from 
the problems sorting and regulating metals  to the
non-enzymatic reactions copper can undergo with a variety
of organics in food. Once in the body, the ability to 
distribute and use copper depends on other nutrients
maybe more than is the case with other vitamins or minerals. 

As many conditions linked to copper may be considered age
related,  quality of the GI tract as a function of age may be 
relevant. 
GI health and in particular stomach acidity may be important
facotrs in copper uptake but also distribution if other
nutrient deficiencies are created.  Naively, you may expect
low acid to reduce solubility of cations or metals
and decrease enzymatic activity for digestion of proteins. 
\mjmtolx{Copper uptake may depend on anions such as chloride
at least in some fish 
\cite{Handy_Musonda_Phillips_Mechanisms_Gastrointestinal_Copper_2000}
,suggesting GI chloride per se may require more investigation.
Content in drinking water is variable and may be perceived
by humans depending on factors like pH \cite{Hong_Duncan_Dietrich_Effect_copper_speciation_2010} sugesting it may be perceived by dogs too.
}
Copper solubility is pH dependent \cite{10.1093/chemse/bjl010}
similar to the competing element zinc for which absorption
 has been shown to depend on salt type as well as 
gastric pH \cite{PMID8577018}.
Interaction with food components such as polyphenols is significant
and pH dependent 
\cite{PMC3401972} motivating a larger interest in food interactions
and in particular rings such as in tyrosine. 
Speciation gradients
may be large in the range of possible stomach acid levels.  
A 2021 study did in fact explore copper speciation in simulated
gastic juices with food components such as 
tyrosine and citric acid among others \cite{PMC8441336}.
Impact of GI pH on broiler chicks has been studied due to impact
on nutrition and micrbial populations 
with  Cu-Zn antagonism also observed in the digestive system 
\cite{Pang_Applegate_Effects_Dietary_Copper_2007}.

% \mjmtol{ put somewhere }
Some information about stomach pH variations may come
from the large number of human PPI users.
PPI's  can raise stomach pH from 2 to 6 and produce "profound 
hypochlorhydria" \cite{PMC4254461}. The latter point may be
important as Cl as much or more  than H may have impact on microbiome
and gastric chemistry. 
There is  a conjectured tumor protective effect from PPI usage
and  a suggestion
that pH 6 encourages cancer progression
versus pH 8 \cite{PMC7085403}
yet alkaline stomach pH is observed is commonly observed
in gastric carcinoma \cite{10.1007/978-4-431-68246-2_26}.
Usage for suppression of colorectal cancer has been suggested
\cite{Kim_Lee_Hong_Novel_Application_Proton_}.
Empirically however gastric cancer rates do correlate 
posivily although arguably with PPI usage
\cite{Waldum_Sordal_Fossmark_Proton_pump_inhibitors_PPIs_2018}
\cite{Segna_Brusselaers_Glaus_Association_between_proton_pump_2021}
\cite{PMC10308480}
.
Probably the dominant effect on tumors is unrelated to ambient
pH although increased pH may reduce nutrient
accumulation by many cells. An absolute apoptosis rate
at near neutral pH is probably not indicative of the
overall fitness in the stomach. 
The effects going from pH 6 to 8 say nothing about the effects
of going from pH 6 to pH 2 as one extreme says nothing about the other. 
Its important to note that they do seem to aid eradication of
H pylori and therefore should reduce gastric cancer rates
if bacteria are involved 
The PPI's appear to attack H. Pylori directly 
\cite{Saniee_Shahreza_Siavoshi_Negative_Effect_Protonpump_2016}
\cite{Atif_Hatefi_Arven_Consumption_antibacterial_2024}
. Its claimed that H pyloti can  survive down to pH 4 but only grow
between 6 and 8 \cite{Marcus2023} affirming a role for
acid in control of these pathogens. 
its been observed as early as  1994 that Omeprazole inhibits
survival of several organisms at low pH while H pylori
only has a benefit in the presence of urea
but the PPI effect is urease independent
\cite{McGowan_Cover_Blaser_proton_pump_inhibitor_1994}.
Clinical effect  of PPI's probably does not relate to increased
somach pH and would  not be decreased with concurrent
intake of acids or chloride which may further improve microbiome.

Omeprazole was also shown to inhbit ATP7A, a copper transporter,
precenting melanogenisis 
\cite{Matsui_Petris_Niki_Omeprazole_Gastric_Proton_2015}
and in fact a number of side effects are known 
along with vitamin deficiencies 
\cite{PMC10248387} with the latter likely contributors to the former
many of which are common in old age motivating the idea of exaggerated
agining in terms of disease.  .

Other metals may also compete with copper directly or
by regulatory loops.
Iron intake in feed has also been observed to decrease
copper uptake in ruminants 
\cite{Clarkson_Paine_Kendall_Evaluation_solubility_2021} 
and rats
\cite{Lee_Ha_Collins_Dietary_Iron_Intake_2021}
.
One work suggested  iron disrupts copper homeosstasis
independent of uptake
\cite{Ha_Doguer_Collins_Consumption_high_2017}.
Zinc is a known inhibitor of cuppoer uptake
and cases of zinc induced copper deficiency in humans
are known\cite{PMC7495772}.
In chicks, and humans as discussed later, silver may induce
copper deficiency through unknown means but mercury
may improve apparent copper status only being toxic 
in copper sufficient animals
\cite{Hill_Starcher_Matrone_Mercury_Silver_Interrelationships_1964}.
Competition between Cu, Fe, and Zn was observed in Caco-2
cells \cite{ARREDONDO_MARTINEZ_NUNEZ_Inhibition_iron_2006}.

While concerns exist about copper content in dog foods, a
recent survey of some zinc content shous many foods 
contain amount above recommended maxima and few are
low or deficient \cite{PMC8066201}.
Age related absorption problems in people
are known \cite{PMC5133110} and other apparent deficiencies 
could be a consequence of
insufficient B-6 alone \cite{PMID7814236}.
Interestinly, B-6 is added to penicillamine treatment of
Wilson's disease to avoid neurological effects
\cite{PMC3526418}.
\mjmtol{
Since paradoxes are a concern here, its worth noting that pyridoxine
is an inhibitor of PLP and high dosese result in functional B-6
deficiency \cite{Vrolijk_Opperhuizen_Jansen_vitamin_paradox_2017}.
}

Dietary cholesterol appears to distrurb copper homeostasis 
with atherosclerosis thought to involve copper dysregulation
\cite{PMID33661473}
and high fat diets in other species \cite{PMC5167165} are an issue.
Fructose also inhibits relative copper absorption
\cite{ODell_Fructose_mineral_metabolism_1993}
\cite{PMID7825519}.

This work describes inclusion of copper into a set
of supplements for dogs with different conditions and unknown genetics 
showing generally beneficial results  or at least
no obvious harm with added copper.
This result is in contrast to some of the popular expactations
cited above.
A descrepancy between expectations and outcome 
of this type seems to be common in medicine
even as late as clinical trials 
so understanding the causes of that
in this partciular case may help optimize
dog supplements and avoid delays in understanding the
limitations of data and theory  to design 
therapeutic interventions.  
Interpretation of the copper literature may be  limited by 
unqestioned assumptions and common logidcal fallacies. 
 Some types of problems
are listed in  \mjmrefapp{errors} as a general giuide. 
\mjmtol{ this is rambling and vague maybe save the point for
coagulation, alzheimer's etc where it is more to the point }
One common problem that may turn out to be relevant here
is a belief in opposites and condluging that if decreasing
some quantity helps then there is no benefit in increasing
it at another extreme. In fact, many control loops appear
to "try harder" with goal related feedback.
if somethign doesn't work which may be due
to quality and feedback measuring results. Instead of disabling
the system, fix it with more of what it needs. In the case of copper,
local deficiencies simultaneous with excess may indicate a lack
of some other nutrient that is believed to be bad.  
In the case of coagulation, isolation of the trigger from 
coagulation system should stop the clotting but a low enough
quality clot may never achieve that goal creating larger
less functional clots.  In essence similar to perhaps hypertrophy
in response to cues for more.  


A 2010 work suggested that high copper and iron intake were
particularly dangerous in older people observing that
one study concluded high intake of both was assoicated with increased cognitive
decline 
\cite{Brewer_Risks_Copper_2010}.
Part of the reluctance to supplement "high" copper doses
is the accumulation in the livers of some dogs but
relation to any clinical disease is not clear. This
may be similar to amyloid beta in Alzheimer's
Disease and pointing to the need to understand cause
and effect before an all out attack on one molecular
entity.  

Even after all the antibody work trying to identify
the right physical conformation and peptide,
confusion exists about the role or anyloids. 
A recent example may be the identification of amyloid
beta as a nominally protective substance
\cite{Yu_Wu_Amyloid_upbeta_double_2021}
\cite{PMID35673950}
 instead of
the cause of Alzheimer's pathology and target
for intervention. 
Recently amyloid beta was even found to promote osteogenesis
\cite{PMC11301219} which of course may moderate another problem
common in old age osteoporosis.
Recently it was found that PRSEN1 mutations do not appear
to generate neurodegeneration through amyloid beta 
\cite{PMID39136994}.
Its toxicity may even result from gamma secretase inhibition
\cite{PMC11259434} which had been considered a therapeutic interventio.

It may still be possible to optimize the amount creating
passing benefits that are inherently limited and difficult
to control. 
That state of affairs is well documented
in the works
that hint at it unravelling\cite{PMID37833948}  such as a 2002 work
suggesting that  "tauists" and "baptists" could 'shake hands"
and look for other causes \cite{PMID11801334}.
Interestingly, related to copper,
is the emerging role of lysyl oxidase in Alzheimer's
as a possible target 
where it associates with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and
is thought to be a drug target 
\cite{Kelly_Sharp_Thomas_Targeting_lysyl_oxidase_2023}
\cite{PMC11042178}. However,  upregulation would have to be
suspected as a part of regeneration attempting to fix
degeneration. 
Indeed, LOXL2 is known to be regenerative
\cite{Tashkandi_Alsaqer_Alhousami_LOXL2_promotes_aggrecan_2020}.

Other counter-intuititve approaches are wasy to find. 
Previousy, heartworm positive dogs had been given
significant amounts of vitamin K
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2021-003-v0.50rg}
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2019-001-.1li}
 although severe
case may be conventionally treated with anitcoagulants. In thise
case, it may not be clear that vitamin K effects clot
quality and consequently may limite pathological quantities
allowing for beneficial clots to form.

Blood peressure, which is not a clinical endpoint per se ,
has been associated with coppers status. While it is not 
central to this work, it illustrates some of the issues
introduced above and is good context for the current
work on clinical diseases.

A 2021 work exploring the association between serum copper
levels and hypertension in US children and adolescents
stated
\cite{Liu_Liao_Zhu_association_between_serum_2021}
"
As suggested by previous literature, serum copper appears to reflect the status of copper nutrition in both depleted and replete populations. "
The present work however tends to accept that ceruloplasmin and
blood copper levels are a reaction to stresses such as infection
and a high level simply indicates some other pathological process
likely exists.  While blood levels can be elevated in response to
a stress, its not known how well other functions 
such as electron transport are able to continue. 

As erly as 1993, one work with Dahl salt-sensitive rats
suggested that indeed copper blood levels were a response
to hypertension 
\cite{Garrow_Clegg_Metzler_Influence_hypertension_1991}.

Things that do matter to the host  related to blood pressure include
cardiac workload,
vascular pressure hhandling limits and adequate nutrient delivery.
Any of these are likely complicated functions of long term diet
details.

Ruminant sensivitivy to dietary sulfur may be an interesting
example of how a mild pH step can product insoluble
copper products creating profound deficiency.
Its unclear on the extent to which this can occur in dogs or
humans but it is illustriative.
Even in this animals, 
decisions about copper supplementation are also difficult in
economically important ruminants \cite{PMC7602799}.
In pigs, 60 percent fed a copper deficient diet died from coronary disease
while supplementation as high as 250mg/kg diet, well in excess of th 10mg/kg
diet requirement, can be growth promoting on a typical pig diet 
\cite{Espinosa_Stein_Digestibility_metabolism_2021}

Interactions between methionine and copper were investigated in turkey
\cite{KASHANI_SAMIE_EMERICK_Effect_Copper_with_1986}.

An investigation of copper and sulfur containing amino acids
showed marked interactions while suggesting copper toxicity
was due to "chemical nature of the diet rather than to any specific
copper induced nutritional deficiencie"
\cite{ROBBINS_BAKER_Effect_High_Level_1980}

Ruminants differ substantially from non-ruminants and notably
rumen  pH is only around 6 reducing solubility
of relevant minerals while allowing formation of insolubles 
\cite{Spears_Trace_Mineral_Bioavailability_2003}.
This may motivate interest in  issues with age related reduced
stomach acid in humans. The low pH GI stage may 
reduce sensitivity to dietary idiosyncracies.  The presence of
a stage able to nucleate insoluble nutrient blobs may
prohbit later abosprtion.  

A study of a problem with Przewalski gazelles found no difference
in forage copper with clinical status but did find 
important difference in sulfur in forage and soi
\cite{PMC2777290}.
That work also identified  biomarkers such as
hair copper content although in this case the copper deficiency
related to sulfur excess was so bad liver and blood levels were low
too.

\mjmtol{ repeated citations in  discussion }

Taurine  has been observed to reduce
copper toxicity in rats with increased feacal copper
amounts \cite{PMID9609396} suggesting decreased
absorption. 
Another work demonstrated taurine reduced ceruloplasmin only
in rats fed a  control diet but not a high-fat diet
\cite{Krol2020}.
As taurine is being explored for various indications,
including DCM \cite{PMC9257265},
supplementation could  relate
to induced copper defieincy which would likely cause some
symptoms expectedd of copper  defieincy.

\mjmtolx{
While not a primary focus of this work, the issues with
forage quality in grazing animals may be instructive
and even suggest issues with low stomach acid.

While sulfur containing amino acids have the most obivous
interactions with copper, this work tends to focus on the
ringed amino acids - Tryptophan (W) Histidine(H) Tyrosine(Y).
W and Y are thought to vary signficantly with age and histidine
is importnat for copper binding to proteins.  
Notably tyrosine protexts ceruloplasmin
and 6 histidines, one for each copper, are required for
a functional enzyme. Mistranslation due to insufficiency
will be exaggerated  by the higher power if all need to be right. 
There is some indication that "diseases of old age" 
are at least partially medicated by sarcopenia,
most reecently atrial fibrillation
\cite{PMID38739369}
consistent with earlier ideas linking age to
amino acid staration
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2021-007-.1-table-rg}
.

There are several works exploring the interactions in various 
places. 
In growing rate, 
"Excessive tyrosine and phenylalanine caused a marked increase in serum copper and ceruloplasmin activity, whereas excessive cystine, methionine, and histidine caused a decrease in the ceruloplasmin activity. " \cite{1990485}
Copper chelated to amino acids may be more robust against Cysteine
( and ascorbate ) inhibition 
\cite{Aoyagi_Baker_Copper_Amino_Acid_Complexes_1994}.

Interest in the interaction of tryptophan with copper
go back to at least 1930 exploring the relation between
tyrosine and tryptophan, among other nutrients, on total 
copper in hen eggs and subsequent hatchability \cite{PMC1254774}.
Interest in the interaction of tryptophan with copper
go back at least to 1973  when urinary metabolites were measured
with different copper intakes
\cite{Gray_Daniel_Effect_Copper_Status_1973}.
Trp was found to reduce toxicity of copper to the Caspain rach
\cite{Fatahi_Hoseini_2013}
and teleosts
\cite{Hoseini_PerezJimenez_Costas_Physiological_roles_tryptophan_2019}.
while improvine response of grass copper to envinromental copper 
\cite{Wen_Feng_Jiang_Dietary_tryptophan_modulates_intestinal_2014}.

One study found histidine decreased while tryptophan increased
copper absorption 
\cite{Wapnir_Balkman_Intestinal_absorption_copper_1990}.

\mjmtolx{.  no relevance to copper  }
While not directly cpmcermomg copper some related observations
suggest what may occur. 
Drosophila shows a non-monotonic but generally increasing 
 relationship between tryptophan intake and zinc stores 
and the authors point to microrganisms living or killed to
be able to modulate Fe,Cu, and Zn to varying degrees
\cite{Garay_Schuth_Barbanente_Tryptophan_regulates_Drosophila_2022}.

Interestingly, Scavenger Rceptor BI contains 8 highly
conserved tryptophans
\cite{Holme_Miller_Nicholson_Tryptophan_Critical_2016}
which appear important for cholesterol transport
suggesting trp deficiency will slow down its translation
, lead to early termination, 
or create many imperefect receptors. 
So, deficiency of these amino acids may produce broad 
non-specific problems that appear to be common
in intractable diseases often associated with old age.

The known biolgoical roles for copper suggest it may
be an important limitation in functions that relate to common
diseases yet 
understadning of the body's copper distribution is limited.
This work addresses the topic by folloing a group of dogs
with varied conditions and 
outcomes as supplementation changed. 
It is probably unique in reporting variations in many
dietary components although lacking some common
metrics like daily calorie consumption. 

Interest in the dog feeding work is first motivated by introduction
of the diseases likely to be modified by copper intake
and then the specific sites of the most important copper
activity. The first section makes the work relevant to
achieving clinical benefits but the second part helps determine
things like time scales over which changes may be observable.
This is particularly important here as copper may have different
effects on different time scales making symptom changes 
difficult to interpret. 


While the diets were guided by many hypotheses, the results are
hypothesis generating or refining rather than attempts at 
proving  any specific tractable ideas.
Taken together this work supports the idea that 
supplementation in the .5mg/kg range added to the
"background diet" produces no obvious harm and may 
solve some of the conditions discussed. 
Given the complexity of diets in general and the recurring 
problems with ostensibly better approaches, this may present
unique data and results with atypical limitations and artifacts.
The reported results should be thought provoking on their own 
but hopefully 
the overall complexity of this simple " feeding dogs at home" effort
is  amernable to analysis
with emerging AI or related methods.

Copper homeostasis is a much larger issue including in human
health with regard to such unresolved diseases as 
Alzheimer's where the decades of work on amyloid beta
is becoming more clearly futile. 

In humans lysyl oxidase is sometimes discussed as
a drug target as its quantity seems to increase in pathological
situations. 
This may suggest that additional copper would not likely
help. 

To help with this apparent conundrum, this work describes
variable copper supplementation to a group of dogs
over several years including one pregnant pit bull with
uterine fibroids. Generally beneficial results 
were associated with copper supplementation in the context
of broader rationally designed supplements.
Apparent benefits to a group of puppies included infection 
control. Additional respiratory infections were
thought to be modulated in older dogs described
here as Cookie( AKA Mixie ) and Trixie. It may have
reduced transmission to the larger group in the latter case.
Also an association with likely non-infectious coughing
was seen in the case of Happy. 

Given the varied canine genetics and known copper related
diseases, vigiliance for adverse reactions was maintained
but to date only questionable events, such as reduced
appetite, remain. 

Copper and vitamin K have both seen literature suggesting
a role for liver health under some conditions. Vitamin K is
note worthy because of many efforts to antagonitze
its effects similar to the present  concerns with copper. 

 
These cases are described in more detail with the hope of
sorting out cause and effect between diet and clinical
outcomes as fixation on one nutrient at  a time may not
be productive. 


The original motivation for copper was based on notions
similar to the table below which reflects current
thinking based on results presented here. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This work illustrates that empirically clinical deficiency
may be more common in some groups of dogs than meaningful excess
in that supplementation, in the context of the rest of the 
diet,  improves apparent health.
If that hypothesis can be shown to be more generally
true, the coppper literature may illustrate some common
fallacies and errors common to biology related
literature and likely other genres involving complicated
systems. 
However copper intake issues are resolved, the complexity of
copper handling may make it a good topic to understand larger
issues in system identification. 
}
\mjmtolx{
However, the empirical data and known theory or
biological pathways don't estalish a causal role
for excessive intake of copper as a problem in most cases.
Rather, other nutrients may be lacking to properly
deploy existing copper reources and likely other
things. In the particular case of copper accumulation
in the liver, its important to note that import and
export are controlled by different things. 
While import appears to be controlled by diet and
remote signals from the heart and binding
to albumin, export may be
limited by ceruloplasmin and excretion.


This work describes in more detail the theoretical and empirical
motivation to consider copper supplementation carefully
as part of a lrger supplementation progam.

The importance of copper to quantity and composition
of structural proteins, in this case elastin, has been known
since at least 1954
\cite{Starcher_Hill_Matrone_Importance_Dietary_Copper_1964}.

Collapsed trachea and related airway defects have
been well described in humans, dogs, poultry,  and other animals such as 
horses. The differences in the literature are significant  
suggesting either important  differences in  diseases or 
literature fragmentation. The dog literature does not appear
to consider copper as a factor directly but interest for this
paper is motivated by consdieration of the larger body of
information. Copper may be involved either in cartilage quality
or in infection control. 
Copper deficiency has been associated with lung
development defects in rats \cite{PMC2018314} and airway and arteriole elastin
were at least partially restored after 60 days of additional copper.
Interestingly, copper "eluting" stents are being explored 
to prevent blood vessel "collapse" or restenosis in humans due to
\cite{PMC11256920} due to some of the properties considered
here and its unclear why dietary copper would work less well. 

A variety of causes are know in humans \cite{PMC4948224}.
"Excessive dynamic airway collapse" notably is a rare side effect
from anti-viral treaments for hepatitis \cite{PMC11260405}.
In humans, it is a rare disease regardless of cause
and  CT observation of a "collapsed trachea" may result
in  debate over actual names for the condition 
\cite{PMC4342702}
with  surgery as a common treatment.

Horses and mules suffer from collapsed trachea too.
Mostly small breed or miniatures horeses were thought
to be most susceptible
but a  1992 case report of a horse with pneumonia noted
that collapsed trachea resolved with infection cure
and just due to infection related inflammation  
\cite{PMID1624350}  
. Currently it appears two causes are noted with the infectious
resolving on cure. 

In poultry infectious causes appear to dominate the concerns
.% same ref lol. ZZ
Turkey infected with Bordetella avium expereienced trachea 
collapse which was attributed to copper mediated crosslinking
\cite{Yersin_Edens_Simmons_effects_Bordetella_1998}
even though collagen content was reduced. 
This points to a role for copper but suggests it makes the
trachea worse. 
A study of  silver nanoparticle effects on broiler
chicks infected with Escherichia coli 
found 
\cite{Awaad_Moustafa_Zoulfakar_role_silver_2021}.
\begin{quote}
the T3 [ highest dose ]  group revealed congested round heart, thickening of crop and esophagus,
atrophy of BF, thymus, and spleen, enlarged gall bladder with watery content,
collapsed trachea, and internal hemorrhage.
\end{quote}

which includes  possible results of copper deficiency. Interestingly,
high dose silver has been documented to 
decrease ceruloplasmin synthesis and serum copper
concentration 
\cite{Natelson_Baker_Pyatt_Anemia_leukopenia_following_2019}
\cite{Stepien_Taylor_Colloidal_silver_ingestion_with_2012}.
It is not surprising that silver could be confused with copper
as analogs can be inhibitory but as discussed elsewhere
cerulomplasmin synthesis can proceed without copper
but the protein may not be properly metallized. The reduction
in synthesis is surpising although perhaps only copper containing
ceruloplasmin was assayed and details need to be considered.
The authors aldo mention other means 
than mis-metallization that silver or othermetals can create
a copper deficiency.


There is a lot of literature on dogs with many causes and
therapies discussed but little overt inclusion of copper.
One author introduces the topic as 
\cite{Tappin_Canine_tracheal_collapse_2016}.
%author email: st@dwr.co.uk
% check foodoo for line endings wtf? merged words 
\begin{quote}
Tracheal collapse occurs most commonly in middle-aged,
small breed dogs. Clinical signs are usually proportional to the degree of
collapse, ranging from mild airway irritation and paroxysmal coughing to
respiratory distress and dyspnoea. Diagnosis is made by documenting dynamic
airway collapse with radiographs, bronchoscopy or fluoroscopy. Most dogs
respond well to medical management and treatment of any concurrent comorbidities.
Surgical intervention may need to be consideredin dogs that do not respond
or have respiratory compromise. A variety of surgical techniques have been
reported although extraluminal ring prostheses or intraluminal stenting
are the most commonly used. Both techniques have numerous potential complications
and require specialised training and experience but are associated with good
short- and long-term outcomes.
INTRODUCTION
Canine tracheal collapse is a
progressive disease occurring mainly in middle-aged small and toy breed dogs.
Degeneration of thetracheal cartilage rings as a result of reduced glycosaminoglycan and
cellularity leads to dorsoventral flattening of the trachea and laxity of
the dorsal tracheal membrane. 
\end{quote}


Alternatively, it has also been introduced as 
\cite{PMC5746443}
\begin{quote}
Tracheal collapse (TC) is a congenital cartilaginous tracheal ring problem
to which small-breed dogs are predisposed. It is usually diagnosed by performing
radiography, fluoroscopy, and tracheobronchoscopy. Tracheobronchomalacia
is a structural defect of the trachea and bronchial cartilages. It results
in flattening of the trachea and bronchial lumen. Affected tracheae show
hypocellularity of the cartilages, loss of hyaline cartilage, and deficiencies
of chondroitin sulfate, calcium, and glycosaminoglycans {[}7{]}. Fifty-one
percent of dogs with a chronic cough exhibit tracheobronchomalacia, a condition
regarded as a common cause of cough. More toy-breed dogs than dogs of other
breeds show tracheobronchomalacia when they have a chronic cough {[}13{]}.
Upper airway obstruction, infectious tracheobronchitis, heart enlargement,
parasitic disease, obesity, and oral problems can exacerbate clinical signs
of TC {[}12{]}. However, studies investigating TC in patients without a
history of cough are lacking.
\end{quote}


Therapies in dogs can involve surgical interventions but also
some of the following 
\cite{PMC9330478}
\begin{quote}
Medical management can include antitussive therapy, antibiotics, bronchodilators,
and/or anti-inflammation medication, e.g., corticosteroids and NSAIDs) (21,
22). Many dogs respond to this medical therapy, but some have complications,
especially with long-term use of corticosteroids which increases the risk
of secondary bacterial infection, increases the respiratory rate, and induces
weight loss that worsens the patient's clinical signs (3, 23).
\end{quote}

the above work also largely endorses a specific commercial product
noted for polyunsatured fatty acid content. As described later, Happy
appeared to worsen on a low fat meat diet making this an interesting
report. 


\mjmtolx{
Collapsed trachea may cause a cough on either
inhalation or exhalation with a distinct honking sound.  

Collapsed trachea
or tracheobronchomalacia
is  considered as a group of conditions
making the trachea too narrow for at least
part of the breathing cycle. 
Symptoms and features are well known in dogs  
and is somewhat age related
\cite{Jeung_Sohn_An_retrospective_study_2019}
although also described as congenital
\cite{PMC5746443}.

}

This work is predicated on the idea  that 
there is  often  a nutritional component 
to cartilage quality and quantity 
with amino acid limitation being one factor but also
physiological crosslinking which depends on copper
in lysuyl oxidase \cite{PMC7204390}.
This should be distinguished from pathological crosslinking
which may occur through other mechanisms. 
While much is not known about cartilage crosslinking,
turnover, and remodeling some recent results do point
to unexpected beneficial effects of copper mediated
cross linking over week time scales \cite{PMID25907046}.
A role for LOXL in aggrecan processing has been described
\cite{Tashkandi_Alsaqer_Alhousami_LOXL2_promotes_aggrecan_2020}.

%Collapsed trachea in dogs does not appear to be commonly associated with copper in the literature.

\mjmtolx{
  although copper storage disease seems to be an
active area of investigation\cite{PMC4783930}
 and copper status does come up
in other investigations of tracheal damage as highlighted above.
It is possible that the original motivation
 is partially correct and that extra copper combined with garlic did
 allow for better crosslinking to stiffen tracheal cartilage and
 prevent dynamic collapse and "honking".

Heart problems are common in dogs. Recently, diet-associated DCM 
has made headlines as an increasing threat
with copper deficiency mentioned as a possible although unlikely contributor 
as it is "routinely supplemented" in commercial foods
\cite{10.1093/jas/skaa155}
. While it is
thourght to be diet related, no clear recipies have been
identified for causing or preventing it. The heart is
particularly dependent on continuous efficient energy
production and mechanical properties to insure blood
flow as needed. As copper is important in both functions,
distribution within the heart could be expected to be
critical to overall health and therefore signalling
for copper regulation. Indeed this seems to be the case
A recent review of diet related DCM mentions copper along
with sulfur containing amino acids as possible issues
While expressing
a concern about interactions with other metals,
 it  does not appear to mention a possible
interaction with the sulfur reducing copper usage.

HCM,  defined as 
" echocardiographically-demonstrated LV concentric hypertrophy in the absence
of another known cardiac, systemic, or metabolic disease capable of producing
the magnitude of LV wall thickening evident" 
\cite{Schober_Fox_Abbott_Retrospective_evaluation_hypertrophic_2022}.
It is  considered rare although it was initially
considered rare in humans whie now being fairly common
with a wide spectrum of symptoms
\cite{Tuohy_Kaul_Song_Hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_future_2020}. 
.
 Energy depletoin is thought to occur due to 
causative mutations but as of 2019 no
disease modifying or proven therapies exist
although Mavacamten apaprently reduced outflow obstructions  in as
little as 2 weeks
\cite{Tuohy_Kaul_Song_Hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy_future_2020}. 




As early as 1993, copper restriction in rats was observed to 
produce cardiomuuoptahy
\cite{Medeiros_Davidson_Jenkins_Unified_Perspective_1993}.
while reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity was observed
in 1999 paricularly with simultaneously high fat diets
\cite{Jalili_Medeiros_Wildman_Aspects_Cardiomyopathy_1996}.
Altohough confusingly copper chelation with trientine
is also thought to show promise in HCM treatment 
\cite{Reide001803} but its unclear exactly how how
it rearranges copper distribution. 

The heart relies on 4 valves and a rapid contraction subsequent
to depolarization to move blood through the body. Mechanical
properties of the valves as well as energy efficiency may be expected
to be important to maintain performance without desperate remodelling. 
These requirements motivate an interest in accurate protein
translation, and copper dependent physsiological crosslinking, removal of
deposits such as mineralization, and mitochondria performance. 
Empirically, copper deficiency can lead to cardiac hypertrophy with increased
mitochondria \cite{PMID12539966}.
Dilated and hypertrophic cardiac myopathy can both
be related to mitrochondria with  "oxidative stress"
as a signal for more copper at cytochrome oxidase. "Oxidative stress"
has been reported to increase muscle mass while 
reducing performance \cite{Ahn_Ranjit_Premkumar_Mitochondrial_oxidative_stress_impairs_2019}.
"Oxidative stress" is often blamed in the literature as 
a cause of various problems but it may in fact also be a signal.
ROS signalling is well known by now but specifically
it may help get sufficient copper to the mitochondria.

As early as 2008, a pressure overload mouse model of DCM 
regressed with copper supplementation
\cite{PMC2671677}.
An recent 2023 work demonstrated correlations between heart copper
content and cardiac parameters in a group of identically fed mice
while also pointing to the heart as a regulator of copper concentration
overall \cite{10.3389/fcvm.2023.1089963}.

\mjmtolx{
Copper loading
of cytochrome C oxidase relies on an oxidized
Cox11 to interact with Cox19 \cite{Bode01072015} and this may be inhibited
by GSH but is enhanced by GSSG. Redox regulation in the IMS seems to be integral
to proper copper disposition \cite{IUB:IUB1620} and indeed mitochondrial
related signaling \cite{PMC5448071} . The latter reference also points
to tissue specific mitochondrial isoform expression suggesting that maybe
some related diseases are states rather than traits and hence correctable with
signaling.
 Certainly excess antioxidants would be suspicious ( for example reference 24
\cite{PMC3852343} in \cite{PMC5448071}) .
However, the enhancement by GSSG suggests that the presence of oxidized antioxidants
may be beneficial but not in their reduced state.
}

Over the  same time however, concerns about diet linked
DCM in dogs have emerged.  A genetic link is also being
investgated and a recent GWAS in dobermans pointed to two genes,
RNF207 and PRKAA2 as risk factors \cite{PMC10506233}
 but did not mention copper. 
However, RNF207 may mediate degradation of ATP7A
\cite{Zhao_Zeng_Wang_Targeting_2023}
while PRKAA2 comes up in cuproptosis 
\cite{10.3389/fcell.2022.996307}.

Dobermans are at remarkably high risk of DCM 
\cite{Ezer_Saarinen_Katayama_Identification_novel_genetic_2023}.
Interestingly, "standard Dobermans" are also at high risk for hypothyroidism
\cite{PMC9552398}.

Its possible the two concerns are related in more copper
is being absorbed as less is  transported to target organs
such as the heart.
This connection between dysregulated copper metabolism and 
heart disease has been considered recently in humans
\cite{PMC8838622} in a work that reviews many important
aspects of copper metabolism. .

Contrary indicators also exist. A study of DCM among people 
exposed to metals at a mining area suggested blood copper levels
increase with DCM risk and found near 100 percent DCM rates
above a threshold level \cite{MalambaLez_TshalaKatumbay_Bito_Concurrent_Heavy_Metal_Exposures_2021}.
However, even assuming blood copper is proptional to exposure,
the x-axis in the graph is more likely a sum of exposures
and not just copper.  That it, is a partial derivative of DCM
risk in a direction that includes copper but also other things
like arsenic. This is a very common problem in association
studies depending on the inputs and population.
In reality blood copper is largely deteremined by an acuate phase
protein and it will be associated with stress until
the total stores are too low which may be well below the
deficiency amounts.

Combined copper and zinc deficiency was observed to
reduce response to \mjmdisease mRNA vaccines with only
minimal copper deficiency 
\cite{Chillon_Demircan_Hackler_Combined_copper_zinc_2023}
The present work considers copper status in light of
other nutrients notably amino acids such as Trp
and Tyr and with zinc being a possible competitor.


In human health, zinc seems to have taken precedence over copper
most recently with some headlines related to the \mjmdisease
pandemic
\cite{Ata_Bradshaw_Zinc_Supplementation_induced_Copper_2024}
\cite{PMC8970610}
. 
Some studies suggest copper is not a factor in \mjmdisease
due to measurements like serum copper levels
\cite{Rozemeijer_Hamer_Heijboer_Micronutrient_Status_Critically_2024}
although ceruloplasmin as an acute phase protein
can elevate levels  during stress even with a 
deficiency in copper
\cite{Harvey_McArdle_Biomarkers_copper_status_2008}.
In  sample of 70 patients presrribed zinc, many had symptoms consistent
with copper deficiency \cite{PMID26085547}



Copper may antagonize many pathogens including
H pylori
\cite{Bernegger_Brunner_VizoviUx0161badcharvv353ek_novel_FRET_peptide_2020}
and clostridum
\mjmtol{
Repression of toxin production by tryptophan in Clostridium botulinum type E
\cite{PMID2256780}. } 


Copper compounds may reduce the virulence of some  organisms for short periods
even if not completely able to clear a pathogen\cite{PMC4542191}
and in particular Cu was recently shown to be effective against
the toxin of one anaerobe  \cite{doi:10.1021/jacs.7b01084} .

One interesting work explored the impact of copper on virulence
of some environmental communities finding decreased virulence
at a higher dose with increased proeudciivity at a lower dose
\cite{Lear_Padfield_Hesse_Copper_reduces_virulence_2023}. 
There are a number of limitations with this work but in general
there is likely to be a beneificial zone in cupper supplementation
to in vivo communicities such as in GI tract.

Copper was shown to correlate negatively with TSH
in one human study and may increase T4 levels 
\cite{10.3389/fendo.2023.1134208}.

Hypothyroidism is a common problem in dogs and has effected
several here \cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2020-007rg}
including some unbpuslihed results where it was thought to contribute
to peritoneal effusion after hearworm treatment. 
It can be defined by elevated TSH for a subclinical condition
or low free T4 or T3 \cite{PMC4554113} although even the latter
remains as a biochemical defintion rather than something relevant
to the patient. 
Ingestion related ( diet low in iodine or containing goitrogen
or relevant drugs ) has been described as a "Rare etiology"
with "aqcuired primary hypothyroidism "  being considered
most common  although iodine deficiency in dogs appears
to be poorly defined 
\cite{Yun_Na_Lee_Case_Report_Technetium_2022}. 
In this work, theer is some evidence that added components
such as iodine, benzoate, tyrosine, and copper may help
and could fit under the catagory " aqauired."

%In any case, it associates with moartliatity and
%heart failrure withour regard to hormone replacement therapy.
%While it is treatable with hormone replacement therapy,
%one unerlying cause may be copper deficiency.
Issues relevant to the patient, those truely clinical, include
lethargy, weight gain, and heart problems. 
With lab confirmation of hypothyroidism it is possible to 
correct levels with supplemental thyriud hormone intake. 
The relevnace to this work however is the ability
of copper deficiency to reduce thyriud output. In such
a case T4 replacement therapy will be limited as the
effects of copper deficiency may still manifest elswhere.


Dobermans are at remarkably high risk of DCM 
\cite{Ezer_Saarinen_Katayama_Identification_novel_genetic_2023}.
Interestingly, "standard Dobermans" are also at high risk for hypothyroidism
\cite{PMC9552398}.

Inerestlingly, copper deficiency in rats can reduce thyroid
hormone levels and body temeprature \cite{Lukaski_Hall_Marchello_Body_temperature_thyroid_1995}.

Of the dofs discussed here, only Rocky was a concern for hypothyroiism although
Happy came back with very low normal thyrroid hormone result prompting
further consideration. Besides iodinne, other contributros may include
tyrisone and sodium benzoate.

Degenerative neurological or muscular diseases
may be intertwined with copper status although 
the relationship is again confusing. Similarly with
arthritis. 

Deficiency seems to effect prefernetially proteins involved
in neuronal projection and diabetes and iron handling
\cite{PMID36583241}.

Rats fed a copper deficient diet shows neurological symptoms
by 7 weeks and had reduced tyrosine hydroxylase and
SOD activity ZZ
\cite{Morgan_ODell_EFFECT_COPPER_DEFICIENCY_1977}.

A 2017 study explored the effects of copper and vitamin C
as well as other molecules such as
clioquninol on abeta and in vitro neurons suggesting
abeta could be cleaved by copper in the presence of oxygen
as well as an anti-oxidant such as vitamin C although
restoration of neuronal functioning was only partial
\cite{C7SC01787A}.
Interestingly, copper-ascorbate oxidation of tryptophan may be
suppressed by Trp chelation of copper at high trp concentrations
\cite{PMID27406076}
suggesting reduced amounts may give copper more ability to damage
an already low supply.
This is interesting in terms of a utrient interaction hypothesis
on copper toxicity.
And in fact as early as 2012 it was determined that
tryptophan intake could reduce copper toxicity at least in carp
\cite{Hoseini_Hosseini_Soudagar_Dietary_tryptophan_changes_serum_2012}.


Some precednce for metal modulated toxicity existed back to 1999
when work with cultured neurons showed a dose dependent
reduction in abeta toxicity with Zn \cite{Lovell_Xie_Markesbery_Protection_against_amyloid_beta_1999}.
By 2005 toxicity of amyloid beta and the metals zinc, iron, and
copper was investigated under conditions that created more toxicity
with iron and zinc but not copper while amyloid beta reduced metal
toxicity in rats
\cite{Bishop_Robinson_Amyloid_Paradox_AmyloidupbetaMetal_2004}.
In 2021, Ni was found in important amounts in a commercial
abeta40 preparation
\cite{Benoit_Maier_nickel_chelator_dimethylglyoxime_2021}
and was found to mediate dityrosine crosslinks
\cite{Berntsson_Vosough_Svantesson_Residue_specific_binding_2023}
similar to the dityrosine crosslinks induced by copper
found in 2004
\cite{Atwood_Perry_Zeng_Copper_Mediates_Dityrosine_Cross_2004}.

A 2013 work found in vitro physiological conditions
caused copper to prevent fibril formation
\cite{Mold_OuroGnao_Wieckowski_Copper_prevents_amyloid_upbeta1_2013}.

By 2022,  work focusing on moving copper into the cell considered
many aspects of copper misallocation and devised a copper specific
shuttle peptide to deliver Cu from abeta  \cite{D2SC02593K}.

At least one recent 2024 work  identified copper dysregulation as a contributor
to microbial contributions to Alzheimer's \cite{PMC11480022}.
While brain copper accumulation has been observed in mouse models
of AD and appears pathological \cite{PMC11624991} any relation
to real disease would be questionable but accumulation may 
be a defense against pathogens or due to other cues that are
more disease relevant. 
Copper distribution in the brain can modulate many functions
from olfaction to adult neurogenesis
\cite{PMC8471899}.
One work in  2022 addressed
AD as a consequence of copper deficnecy because
\cite{Klevay_contemporaneous_epidemic_2022}
\begin{quote}
It is hypothesised that copper deficiency is a plausible cause of Alzheimer's
disease(Reference Klevay84). Patients are thinner than normal; weight loss
precedes dementia and is associated with greater dementia and neurobehavioural
symptoms. Nutritional compromise contributes to morbidity. Cytochrome oxidase
depends on copper for activity; at least fourteen publications reveal decreased
activity in brain of Alzheimer's patients. Brain copper and caeruloplasmin
also are decreased. This hypothesis is the only one that explains why Alzheimer's
disease occurs earlier and is more common in Down's syndrome. Superoxide
dismutase (SOD1) depends on copper for activity; its gene is on chromosome
21. This enzyme is elevated in Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) and is decreased
in people with monosomy. It seems likely that people with Down's syndrome
have a higher than average requirement for dietary copper because copper
is incorporated into superoxide dismutase and is unavailable for other uses.
Thus, Alzheimer's disease fulfills the first two of Golden's criteria (above)
for deficiency.

\end{quote}

Interestingly, iron chelation has failed in AD
even as iron overload is observed with ROS generation
\cite{PMID39031369}. This set of conditions could easily
reflect age related copper loss as mitochondria and iron 
transport systems are limited.
 Another possibility is raised by a  recent work suggesting
that iron accumulation in aortic valve calcification
is a compensatory response to global iron deficiency
\cite{PMID39728514}. In this case then iron chelation may
have to be replaced with supplementation if this "compensatory
hoarding" occurs in the brain which often has priority along
with the heart during nutrient limitation. .  

Folklore regarding copper persists and yet clinical trials
for Cu in arthritis continue to show lack of any benefit
\cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0071529}
even as other controlled tests show some effects of Cu on
processes related to collagen properties
\cite{PMID6110524}

Remarkably, copper sulfae was shown to protect against
ETC damage by MPP \cite{RUBIOOSORNIO20171} suggesting
some activity against toxic insults.
Copper histidine is used to treat Menkes disease
which is a defect in ATP7A
\cite{Munakata_Sakamoto_Kitamura_effects_copper_2005}.



At least one report found a potentially meaningful association
between copper intake and kidney stone odds ratio
with a non-linear but monotonic inverse relationship
\cite{PMC9469499}. This is interesting in the case of Hershey
who was found to have bladder stones.  


\mjmtol{ this may not belong here but relevant to
other Cu stuff,
A recently published work suggests copper delivery is the
important part of a new ALS drug but the work also suggests
a "hyperreductive state" around hypoxic mito that
promote relase of Cu from the drug complex
\cite{Hilton_Kysenius_Liddell_Evidence_disrupted_copper_2024}/
pointing to a possible more general mechnism.
The work goes onto suggest possible role in Parkinson's Disease
but does not address AD.
At least one observational study found a 
negative correlation between odds ratio for Parkinson's and copper
intake \cite{Zeng2024}

The relationship to  cancer  is
probably the most confusing aspects of copper interactions.
However, 
Copper deficiency does not effect proliferation of erythropoietic
cells but it does reduce differentiation and alters metabolism
from mitrochondria to glycolysis 
\cite{Bustos_Jensen_Ruiz_Copper_deficiency_alters_cell_2013}
so it can produce two central fetures of cancerous growth. 
Copper accumulation has been observed in neoplastic cells and
it stimulates angiogenesis \cite{PMC8421569}. While this
suggests a role supporting turmor growth, "acute phase copper"
and improved bllod supply can be part of a healing response. 


Copper has been studied in relation to cancer being
considreed both as a limiting nutrient and a source
of cuproptosis in the overload state
\cite{PMC10327296}.
Copper is essential for many growth processes and can activate
receptor tyrosine kinases without a ligand making it
a target for cancer \cite{PMC6537018}.
However, these processes are also esential for
maintenance and healing in the organism and any net
benefit would have to consider host fitness as well
as cancer cells again using a clinical endpoint to deciee
on approach. 
In some studies, copper depletion was considered to be
motivated by the observation that copper chelatiors
reduced cancer growth and equating chelation with depletion.
However, role confusion may have applied as the
chelated copper could generate ROS's with obvious
cytotoxic acitivity. 


 Copper storage diseases and in essence "overdose" are
well known \cite{Fuentealba2003} % this also mentions absorption idiosyncracies
 and a role in cancer is suspected \cite{PMC5412452}
.
% TODO find the other comments for here 
However, see the comments below about complexed copper actually
being an active compound similar to other drugs,
perhaps Pt based for example,  which may kill cancer.
Copper toxicity has been noted to differ between host cell types
and may be reducible, at least in  Long Evans Cinnamon rats, with thiamine or lipoic
acid \cite{ANA:ANA10276}.
Lysyl oxidase activation, the goal of this therapy, is also associated
with cancer spread \cite{PMC5399287}\cite{PMC5413586}\cite{PMC5297697}
. Although it is likely to remodel
possible tumor locations, its role in growth or  metastases
in a clinically relevant situation is currently unresolved
( see for example \cite{PMC3280126}
 or \cite{PMC5103911} and the survival curve in figure 1).
Incidence of liver cancer in Wilson's Disease patients is remarkably low
\cite{PMC4803712} and a discussion of possible treatment effects
\cite{doi:10.1093/qjmed/hcg114} points out that the copper per
se rather than removal is likely to help while also mentioning
differences with iron overload. Indeed, extra copper that prevents
iron overload may be therapeutic as originally intended.


We should note that complexed copper is not equivalent
to copper deficiency as the complex may not be inert.
However, when an ROS generating complex has been observed it  effects were
diminished by antioxidants \cite{PMC4223620}.
This also suggests that copper depletion per se
may not kill cancer cells as much as copper complexes
and that concerns about copper supplements and cancer may not
be significant.

Copper in these dogs may be beneficial through accumulation
in macrophages and other locations, use by lysyl oxidase to
stiffen trachea and other structural organs, and for
energy production notably by the heart leading to greater
volumetric efficiency. 

Supplemental copper has been noted to improve
symptoms in one case report including symptoms such as hearing loss \cite{PMID15902551}
attributed to defects in cytochrome C oxidase copper loading
and restore function in mutant yeast \cite{doi:10.1093/hmg/ddu069}
.Cytochrome C oxidase levels in rat hearts were shown to
be related to copper deficiency as early as  1998  \cite{Rossi1998}.
It would be interesting to determine if more problems in dogs
are related to specific mutations in mitochondrial copper handling.
We note again that vitamin K could contribute in similar places
and may be synergistic with copper for connective tissue quality
as well as in eukaryotic mitochondria \cite{Vos1306}\cite{PMC5022102}
.

Two types of excess have been identified as potentially
important to pathogenesis- mineral and antioxidant.
Iron overload copper deficiency was identified early on as
a concern with animals getting high iron diets and generally
free of parasites in stark contrast to the likely situation over
evolutionary time scales. A second type emerged on consideration
of the copper response and cytochrome C oxidase copper loading -
that of antioxidant overload. ROS have generally gained more acceptance
as having physiological roles at low concentrations rather than simply
being a source of damage. Literature related to these experiments
suggests a very specific role in mitochondrial function.
The original concern about antioxidant overload was mostly
confined to vitamin E-K antagonism and it is not
clear how or if these concerns relate. Coupled with empirical
deleterious effects of some antioxidant combinations in clinical trials
( one high profile  example \cite{doi:10.1056/NEJM199605023341802} )
,
it is clear that antioxidant excess should be considered
as a problem with some diets.  The antioxidant paradox
now seems to be gaining acceptance , for example see \cite{PMC4412352}
 and \cite{PMC5021979}
.
%label cytoc
%label EK 
Copper is decidedly pro-angiogenic 
and several studies have shown  effects of copper consumption
increasing tumor growth in animals  while both
chelators and ionophores are being investigated for treatments 
\cite{Chen_Min_Wang_Copper_homeostasis_cuproptosis_2022}.
However, pro-growth and angiogenesis could also be expected
during regeneration which itself may require copper. 

\mjmtol{
Copper loading
of cytochrome C oxidase relies on an oxidized
Cox11 to interact with Cox19 \cite{Bode01072015} and this may be inhibited
by GSH but is enhanced by GSSG. Redox regulation in the IMS seems to be integral
to proper copper disposition \cite{IUB:IUB1620} and indeed mitochondrial
related signaling \cite{PMC5448071} . The latter reference also points
to tissue specific mitochondrial isoform expression suggesting that maybe
some related diseases are states rather than traits and hence correctable with
signaling.
 Certainly excess antioxidants would be suspicious ( for example reference 24
\cite{PMC3852343} in \cite{PMC5448071}) .
However, the enhancement by GSSG suggests that the presence of oxidized antioxidants
may be beneficial but not in their reduced state.

\mjmtol{ engineering  ahead of medical, protein quality  }
In some other context, engineering efforts to produce
biological products such as bone in a reacor vessel
can offer insights into factors in vivo.
A 2021 work focused on similar systems by modelling the
effect of amino acids and copper on antobody quality in 
a production setting 
\cite{PMID32875683},
\begin{quote}
{Specifically, copper has a significant, positive effect on titer and a
significant, negative effect on lactatea phenomenon consistently observed
in other CHO cell culture processes.{[}12, 13, 23, 24{]} A plausible explanation
is that the increased copper level is known to drive lactate consumption.
Copper deficiency reduces cytochrome c oxidase activity, limiting the ability
of cells to produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. As a result, cells
switch to aerobic glycolysis to generate ATP, causing increased lactate
production, which affects other metabolic processes.{[}12, 23{]}}
\end{quote}

Lysyl oxidase family  of copper dependent enzymes contributes
to controlled crosslinking of structural proteins such
as in injury recover \cite{PMC6171574}.
They have a central role in organ development and some activity
in disease \cite{PMC7282176} with the latter association
contributing to the idea that inhibition would be beneficial
in many cases. However, the details again point to
"fixing rather than inhibiting" as with  apparently pathological
coagulation. In this case, one problem may be incorrect or
incomplete metallization  which would be fixed with more copper.  
Other deficiencies may similarly alter the overall function of
the LOX enzymes and it may be a better solution to fix these problems
than inhibit LOX. Notable functions for tryptophan and tyrosine exist
and these have been identified as potential concerns before  
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2020-002-0.10}
.

Several works point to the LOX family as a good target due
to persumed causal role in pathological results. 
Lysyl oxidase was considered to be bad for vessels \cite{PMID38402026} 
and calcification
but this may  be related to metallization issues \cite{PMID9524359}.
Lysyl oxidase  expression has been associated with degenerative
mitral valve disease in humans\cite{PMC5541772}.
It has been observed to upregulate in the injured
newborn lung
\cite{Zhong_Mahoney_Khatun_Lysyl_oxidase_regulation_2022}
sugesting increased levels may be a response to an insult
rather than a cause of damage. 
In 2001, it was observed that bovine lyxyl oxidase had enzymatic
activity without copper but was less stable
\cite{Tang_Klinman_Catalytic_Function_2001}
although details on reactions catalyzed could not have
been fully explored. 


Regulation at transcriptional and translation and post-translational
levels is confusing. For example, it has been described in
1998 as \cite{SmithMungo_Kagan_Lysyl_oxidase_Properties_regulation_1998},
\begin{quote}
While enzyme activity levels were decreased in the skin of weanling rats
fed a copper deficient diet, the basal, steady-state levels of LO specific
mRNA or immunodetectable LO protein were not significantly reduced (Rucker
et al., 1996). These results suggest both that the biosynthesis of the enzyme
is not markedly affected by copper deficient diets and that the increasing
percentage of copper-deficient, catalytically compromised enzyme molecules
presumed to accumulate during this dietary treatment remain relatively stable.
Notably, copper-deficient diets significantly reduced cardiac LO activity
and induced cardiac pathology in male but not in female rats (Werman et
al., 1995). 
\end{quote}
or more to the point from the same year,
\cite{Rucker_Kosonen_Clegg_Copper_lysyl_oxidase_1998}
\begin{quote}
Although nutritional copper status does not influence the accumulation of
lysyl oxidase as protein or lysyl oxidase steady state messenger RNA concentrations,
the direct influence of dietary copper on the functional activity of lysyl
oxidase is clear. The hypothesis is based on the possibility that copper
efflux and lysyl oxidase secretion from cells may share a common pathway.
The change in functional activity is most likely the result of posttranslational
processing of lysyl oxidase.
\end{quote}

However, metallization may not be complete
and feedback systems may increase expression to achieve
an activity level. Note too that "crosslinking" is
a variable modification and physiological as well as
pathological crosslinking can occur. 
While "quantity versus quality" will be the subject of
another work, its important to remember that increased
expression of lysyl oxidase genes and more patholoical
crosslinking could occur in the absence of sufficient copper.
Mature functional lysyl oxidase contains an unusual 
 lysine tyrosylquinone (LTQ) which itself is formed in 
a copper dependent process \cite{PMC2749888}.
Depence on multiple tyrosines or tryptophans   can
increase the odss of generating dysfunctional
enzymes which may be inactive or perform unintended functions 
when these amino acids are limited. This theme of amino
acid starvation also appears in concerns about ceruloplasmin
and more generally with aging. 

} % mjmlox 
\newcommand{\mjmcp}{

Ceruloplasmin is an acute phase protein
\cite{PMC3053509}
which serves as the dominant copper carrier in the blood delivering
copper as Cu(I) for uptake by CTRP1  by reverting 
to apoenzyme at cell surfaces \cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0149516}.
As an acute phase protein its concentration may correlate well
with early disease stages but it generally has a productive
role. 
Besides stress modulation, activity may depend on 
factors such as copper availability,
estrogen and progesterone
\cite{PMC8901420} and ,
in wilson's disease, retinoids such as ATRA may improve
ceruloplasmin secretion \cite{Song2021.08.10.455792}.
Ceruloplasmin ( regardless of how assayed)
 and blod copper levels and their fluctuations
 do not have to reflect overall copper sufficiency. 


It is also a  promiscuous enzyme 
\cite{PMC6712297}. While  best known for 
ferroxidase activity,  it can also has oxidize activity against 
cyclic hydroxylamines ( used as ROS probes )
\cite{PMC3448871}
as well as various amino acid derivatives such as  
" catechol and its analogs, such as dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and tryptophan"
\cite{PMC8901420}.

\mjmtol{ may be promiscuois towards neurotrnmitter and amino acid analogs 
which may make it a good means to get rid of spurious analogs with 
build up of these if it is deficiency. Suspected roles in dementia include iron and copper control although not sure if amine oxidase is consered as a way to remove brain "poisons."  }

% some mutations point to problems with Cp when improperly translated or metallized. 

Ceruloplasmin contains 6 coppers
% and two tytosines
and  histidines needed for metallization  
\cite{Hellman_Kono_Mancini_Mechanisms_Copper_Incorporation_2002}.
as well as 2 tyrosines. Independent errors in metallization
will multiple and reduce likelyhood of functional enzyme.  

The blood leveels of ceruloplasmin may correlate well
with copper blood levels but it can vary in quality too. 
A chain  of W and Y  are thought important
for enzyme preservation  with ceruloplasmin containing a chain of
two tyrosines \cite{Tian_Jones_Solomon_Role_Tyrosine_2020}.
As iron accumulation is related to AD, there is a question about
the quality of the circulating ceruloplasmin.  If there is high-infidelity
translation due to W and Y depletion, there is also the question of
how feedback mechanisms control the overall amount.
First is has to metalize right which requires 6 coppers and
6 histidines and then survive with the 2 tyrosines. 
If any components are deficient quantity or quality may suffer. 
Ceruloplasmin KO mice gained weight and showed increased
scatter in weight with lipid dysregulation only partially corrected
wth exogenous replacement
\cite{Raia_Conti_Zanardi_Ceruloplasmin_Deficient_Mice_Show_2023}
sugesting tight control may matter.

Copper in these dogs may be beneficial through accumulation
in macrophages and other locations, use by lysyl oxidase to
stiffen trachea and other structural organs, and for

While well known for a role in infection control,
macrophages also have a complicated role in cardiovascular
disease
\cite{Chen_Zhang_Tang_Macrophages_cardiovascular_diseases_2024}
although the impact of copper may be less apparent.
Recently some work has suggested that lysomal copper may
be an important storage location \cite{10.1039/c6mt00058d}.

The importance of copper for host-pathogen relations is 
well known  as is a prticular usage by macrophages
\cite{10.1039/c4mt00327f}
\cite{PMC5535265}. Note that nutritional immunity 
may involve either an excess or limittation of copper to the
patogen hinting at a common source of myths about
which direction to move a quantity to achieve a given result
 ( see a list in \mjmrefapp{errors} )
.
Much is known about interaactions of copper in macrophages with
particular  organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis
and Salmonella typhimurium 
\cite{PMC3340201}
as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae 
\cite{ACamilli_Role_Copper_Efflux_2015}
.
As with most other sites, copper in macrophages can be
considered pathological and attempts may be made
to limit rather than enhance it.
For example, targeting mitochondrial copper with
"rationally" designed metformin dimers 
\cite{Solier_Muller_Caneque_druggable_copper_signalling_2023}.
As with attempts to control amyloid beta in AD, there may be some
passing benefits but taking all the information together
this is likely of limited value if the simpler approach of
enabling the copper based response in a well regulated way
is feasible.

Copper can of course form associations, with many chemical
groups and diverse roles.  Role confusion however seems
to be a recurring issue as specific componunds may not
sequester or activate copper as may be expected. 
One recent review on anti-cancer mechanisms of copper dicussed
various ligands and roles for both copper depletion
and overload
\cite{Babak_Ahn_Modulation_Intracellular_Copper_2021}.
The combination
of the garlic and copper, while sounding like a medieval concoction
( suggested as a result from Bald's Leechbook \cite{PMC4542191} )
,
has been described as synergistic against fungus \cite{PMID16102883}
and seems plausible for generating perhaps more volatile and diffusable
copper that could find otherwise inaccessible lysyl

Dogs fed a histidine deficienct diet eventually developed
feeding resistance and lower whole blood copper and zinc

Copper was an early part of my interest in optimization of 
supplements for dogs and humans. Recent literature has expressed
concern about copper so I thought I would get out generally
supportive results to date although omitting much of my own
personal experiences ( I'm a human not a dog ) that seem similarly
beneficial. It seems that often the popular press led by science
catches onto incomplete or "close but not quite" ideas and reversals
in recommendations are common. Curious to see how attitudes towards
copper evolve. It may be worth noting there seems to be a trend
to get away from copper plumbing lol.  
Actually looking at the old, unpublished work, "casesum",
that includes Little Man, most of the text is still
useful today and has been copied and pasted without attribution
( since it was a never-published work I authored ).

A lot of introductory material may be more commonly put into
a discussion of later section but its important to motivate the
rather simple work of desining a set of supplements for a group
of dogs. The data re of course ambiguous and the discussion tries
to tie the introduction to the new data without a lot of new citations.

\begin{abstract}
The known roles of copper suggest it is needed to perform
functions that could mitigate several common diseases
yet it  is not currently a trendy supplement for dogs or
humans. Part of the concern with dogs is the variable
genetics and observations of copper accumulation in the liver
becoming more common. However, with most genetics lacking
a recognized  copper storage disease, copper distribution is
regulated by a complex system that appears to consider
locale based demand as part of the uptake and excretion control 
algorithm.  Such a system may produce bottlenecks leading to
uncommonly large accumulation in an organ such as the liver
while another organ such as the heart is starved.
Surch a situation could occur due to some other nutrient
limitation that fools the feedback mechanisms.
Without knowing the specific bottleneck, the decision
to supplement would be based on the overall benefits
to the starving location versus any harms to the 
accumulating organ. 
This work describes copper supplementation to a group
of dogs without obvious significant harm while 
in some cases coinciding with benefits such as
increased energy or reduced coughing. 
Supplementation in the range of .3-1 mg/kgBW/day was most
commonly explored  with .1 thought to be too low and  3
being an old literature NOAEL. 
The "background diet"
is discussed in terms of making extra copper intake useful
to the hosts. While copper interacts with just about everything,
specific interactions with sulfur, amino acids, B-6, and zinc are
considered in more detail.  In atleast one dog, possible
problems also exist with low fat diet, iron excess, and
cherries ( thought to be a problem with fructose)  pointing
to idiosyncracies that are possible. 
Additionally, taurine emerged as a possible interaction
with copper suggesting induced copper deficiency could limit
therapeutric effect. 
A low pH step early in the GI tract 
may prvents the formation of insoluble products creating 
varied outcomes idiosyncartic to particular diets and hosts. 
Those with impaired stomach acid such as the elderly
 may need specific diets or additional supplements. 
The overall diet may help mitigate two contemporary
issues, hepatic copper accumulation and diet related
DCM, in dogs as well as highlight rrecurring issues
with hidden assumptions and logical fallacies when dealing
with non-obvious regulatory feedback systems. Hopefully
this workd leads to a starting point for 
a diet-related disease mitigation strategy and helps
turn paradoxes into paradigms be elucidating some
feedback mechanisms that may be quite common. 
One common issue is jumping to hypothesis testing, usually
due to a "quantity"problem, 
rather than looking at data as a larger opportunity to
generate new or refined hypotheses beyond rationalization.  
It may be common that "quantity" problems are a result of
quality and the feedback control. 
 
\mjmtolx{
Two contemporary diet related dog health issues,
, hepatitic copper accumulation
and dilated cardiomyopathy, may be symptoms
of the same set of nutrient deficiencies with the latter
reflecting cardiac copper deficiency.
The inability to attack each is probably due to 
unexamined assumptions about cause and effect leading
from diet to clinican outcomes. 
In particular, homeostatic mechanisms 
and roles %  ( sequestering vs activating for example )
may need more attention.  Role may come up
in cause and effect but also in action such as sequestering
or depleting versus activating. This type of role confusion
comes up in the copper literature.  
Local nutrient related feedback signals
may cause more copper uptake but be unable to 
deliver it to the heart where it is needed.
Consideration of homeostatic mechanisms,
feedback loops, is often neglected and that may be the case
in the present condundrum.  
This work describes copper supplementation to a group of dogs
over several years with no robust deletious effect established
although some suspicious observations are discussed.
Bnefits associated with copper supplementation,
in the context of more complete supplementation, include 
reduced coughing likely due to infectious
respiratory disease, collapsed trachea,, or dilated / hypertrophic
heart. 
Copper in these dogs may be beneficial through accumulation
in macrophages and other locations, use by lysyl oxidase to
stiffen trachea and other structural organs, and for
mitochondrial energy production notably by the heart leading to greater
volumetric efficiency and reduced size. 
Particular nutrients that may aid transport out of the liver
would likely be those which enhance ceruloplasmin quantity or quality
or othewise modify copper handling. Tryptophan and tyrosine are
two candidates for limiting copper toxicity  and both were generally
supplemented in this group of dogs. Both amino acids have
unique functions and distribution may be modified by many
factors from GI health to overall food chemistry and
microbial metabolism.  Some works implicating copper
quantity in pathogenesis of these or other conditions
is examined for hidden assumptions. 
Of particular note may be that the mitochondrial copper pools
are regulated by oxidized glutathione suggesting
the possibility that antioxidant overdose could
damage this signal leading to insufficient energy
output.  Another is mistaking adequate blood copper levels as a sign
of overall sufficiency rather than a sacrificial accute phase
response. 
This work may be useful in mitigating these two unrelated
issues.

\section{Introduction  }

This work is organized differently from many papers
due to copper's biology and the relationshup between existing
literature and the new results presented herein.
A long redundant introduction  motivates an interest in the topic
in self contained pieces without requiting the entire section  be read.
The novel results are relatively simple dog feeding chronologies
and observations of outcomes. The "case report" section that
descirbes the results for each dog also includes some analysis
and interpretation related to the   introductory material that would
be too distant in the discussion section. 
The discussion is short  comparing and contracting the results
from these dogs with expectations and tentative explanations for
the entire data set.

summarized many of the same issues relating to copper
and cardiovasular disease but with better editing and depth.
However, it does not point to some of the cues outlined herein.

\section{  Diseases of Interest }

Dogs here have suffered from 
conditions that may be modified by copper intake including  
cancer, heart failure, respiratory infection, collapsed
trachea, and hypothyroidism. 
 This work will focus on these conditions as
well as a few others for context as listed in \mjmreftab{disease}. 
The dogs decribed in this work were suspected of having
at least one of these conditions at some point with
various levels of confirmation. 
These conditions
are not mutually exclusive and in fact may relate to each
other when they occur together. 
All of the above conditions may involve cough as one symptom
and disease trajectory or symptoms may be modulated by
copper status. 
Most of these are well associated with cough but 
a couple may be less obvious. 
Cancer may directly effect the lung but nearby tumors
may also irriate the respiratory tract. 
Hypothyroidism is
not commonly associated with cough in dogs although
thyroid enlargement can occur irritating the trachea. 
%The focus of this work is hypothesis generation based on symptoms and quality of life or clinical results easily observed in an informal setting. 
%This work is mostly concerned with the  copper related diseases listed in \mjmreftab{disease}. 

% how did this get here? 
Copper deficient liver patients 
may be  notable for
"steatohepatitis, iron overload, malnutrition, and recurrent infections "
\cite{Yu_Liou_Biggins_Copper_Deficiency_Liver_2019}.

The other diseases in \mjmreftab{disease} do not fit into
this catagory entirely but the role of copper and the state
of literature help put these diseases into context. 

Besides cough, the present works relies  thyroid related
symptoms ( coat quality, weight distribution, energy level etc).
Cough has many possible origins as discussed previously
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2019-001-.1rg}.  "Enegy level"
in most cases described here is thought to relate to 
shorter term fluctuations in mitrochondrial copper
rather than thyroid although its important to consider
all possiblitites. One point of this work is to 
interpret outcomes recognizing that symptoms and disease
trajectory can decouple and notably coughing may increase
as part of a diseas complex resolves.   

Its also important to note that a "state of health" requires
a lot of things to go "right." Not everything need be
"good" as many compensatory mechanisms exist to allow
clinical health with differnet parameters. But, while
a range of copper intakes may be required to allow for
disease free state, failure to produce that state with 
more copper does not prove copper is irrelevant.
And indeed even short term symptoms may not track
disase trajectory. For the sake of writing tractable
overviews, these considerations may be omitted in the following
sections. 


\mjmtolx{
The known roles of copper include pathways and functions 
 important for many common dog diseases.
Actual specific disease diagnoses are lacking in the present
work which relies on ambiguous symptoms.
The present works relies mostly on 'cough" and thyroid related
symptoms ( coat quality, weight distribution, energy level etc).
Cough has many possible origins as discussed previously
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2019-001-.1rg}.  Among these are
respiratory infection or irritation, collapsed trachea, heart failure,
and CNS stimulation. Infection related cough is well known due
to direct irriation. 
Heart failure may initiate fluid build up in the lungs and
other sources of bulk such as a tumor may cause irritation. 
With these source in mind, it is not difficult to find
pathways and locations that require copper for proper functioning.
These have been tabulatedin in \mjmreftab{causes}
along with time scales for the response to reflect changes in 
copper intake. In most cases the distribution is very broad
an non-specific symptoms may be expected. For example,
mitochondria are eveywhere although the heart may be
the first to show symptoms of deficiency. Its also 
important to note that cough monitoring is not
going to be monotonic with improvement as increased
energy may occur quickly resulting in more coughing
until trachea and heart can make adaptive structuctural changes. .

\section{ Sites of Interest }

There are specific locations or interactions
that can make extra dietary copper beneficial
in the above conditions and others.
These are  tabulatedin in \mjmreftab{causes}.
In addition to specific locations, novel
copper compounds may go to many locations
. A  few examples are given  but this is not
exhaustive. 


Copper in these dogs may be beneficial through accumulation
in macrophages and other locations, use by lysyl oxidase to
stiffen trachea and other structural organs, and for
energy production notably by the heart leading to greater
volumetric efficiency.

\section{Cases and Observations}

This section describes the results of adding
copper to diets for a variety of dogs. Context and
individual case interpretation is also included here instead of the
discussion section which is reserved for general observations
about the cases.  

\mjmdogsone


This work tracks a small part of the diet and outcome history of a group
of rescue dogs. %  around the time of a new arrival, Trixie. 
The larger effort is designed to understand their diet and
supplement needs with the hope of optimized feeding for each dog.
The subset of data considered here focuses on variations in copper
intake after the arrival of a new dog, Trixie, with various health
conditions.  
All dogs were fed suitable human quality food and vitamin supplements
in addition to commercial kibble and canned dog food products. 
Relevant part of the diet and outcomes were recorded  in MUQED format
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2020-004-.012rg} immediately
after feeding and as events occured. 
While most supplements and medicines were recorded 
in good detail, several common diet parameters can not be inferred
from this data.
Snacks containing vitamins were generally consumed within minutes
of preparation although in some cases snacks would be refiggerated
and eaten 12 or so hours later sometimes with AM and PM snacks together.
As stability is a concern with copper, this point may be important.
Besides the meal or snack ,
most dogs received additional meals of commercial dog food
and unfortuntately uncontrolled scraps or treats while others
routinely ate toys or yard debris. However, some 
results appear to relate to the vitamin mix and notably
inclusion of  copper. Total calorie intake is not reflected in
the data although some details of the products are indicated
in the MUQED data ( see Supplementary Information ).   
In paricular normalization of the "dinner" amounts is variable
between dogs.
Some of the discussion will also reference unpublised notes
on "Little Man" who was given copper and other 
nutrients before the MUQED system was operating.

Generally copper dosing was rotated leading to high doses
some days with none on intervening days. 
A hard upper limit of
3mg/kg body weight of supplemental copper per day was maintained  based 
on quoted NOAEL's from an  
original source dated  1972 \cite{NAP9782}.
All of the dogs currently living here received increased copper
shortly after the arrival of Trixie due to apparent
spread of coughing. Trixie was later treated with Clavamox
leading to cure suggesting indeed an infectious cause existed. 
Some of the dogs, notably Happy and Rocky, had varying cough levels
previously as described below. 

While all supplement data were recorded and many varied
significantly over time, only a few are discussed here. 
Many of the dogs in this setting have had either symptoms
that could be due to hypothyroidism or overt lab confirmed
low thyronid hormone levels. As iodine intake flucuated 
wildly, it is included in some of the graphs as 
a putative factor confounding inferences about copper. 
The premise of this work is that the total diet is
a "confounding factor" and readers are encouraged to check
the MUQED data for other patterns. As copper chemistry in the
GI tract may be impacted by sulfur, some attention should
be given to sulfur sources such as amino acids including taurine.  


\mjmcasetab

\subsection{Dexter}

\mjmdextercu

Dexter was not originally part of the copper study  but was included after
showing signs of distress and elevated bilirubin.  
He had always been a picky eater but otherwise in good
health with plenty of energy. 
Blood work on 24-07-22
was notable for elevated ALT of 140 ( 10-125 U/l) , total bilirubin
of 1.8( 0-.9 ng/dl ) and ALP $<10$ ( 23-212 U/l). 
Low ALP with signs of liver failure may be diagnostic of
Wilson's Disease but the copper intake pattern did not seem
consistent with that. In Wilson'd Disease, ceruloplasmin is low
\cite{PMC9768184}
and it may be a case of insufficiency coexisting with surplus
leading to a supplementation dillema introduced earlier.
Low ALP activity may be due to  zinc and magnesium  deficiency
\cite{Ray_Singh_Jena_Alkaline_Phosphatase_}.
Zinc and manganese did raise ALP levels in chicks
although copper did not appear important under the conditions tested
\cite{Santos_Gonccalves_Neira_Effects_Supplementation_2023}.
Based largely on the low ALP he was given a metal mixture along
with KCl and various others components ( see "DEXSNACK" in MUQED data )
 such as amino acids.
The mixture added to kibble was well accepted by Dexter and 
others including Annie and Rocky. Metals included iron, magnesium,
zinc, and rarely copper and manganese. He subjectively improved
and he may be even eating better than before. 
The copper intake history did not suggest it was higher
prior t the event during relevant time periods  than it had 
been during prior times thought too distant to be relevant. 
He may be sensitive to copper and it was not a priority to
give him more. 

\subsection{Cookie or Mixie}

\mjmmixiecu

Arrived with diagnosed respiratory infection and prescribed azithromycin.
Copper and other nutirents were added and eventually infection
resolved well. Contribution of any nutrient is unknown but recovery
seemed uneventful.

\subsection{Brownie and puppies}

\mjmbrowniecu

Brownie was the subject of a prior work 
where her uneventful pregnancy was notable
for vitamin K consumption while heartworm posivite
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2021-003-v0.50rg}. 
Subsequent to that work, her abdominal tumor
was removed and diagnosed  by vet as fibroids. 
Briefly, 
Brownie was determined to be pregnant shortly after arrival
. Her  heartworm
was  treated with Diroban after weaning  and fibroids
removed 2021-11-15 well after the puppies were gone. She was
unevntful until being doganosed with cancer and killed
2023-02-22. Prior to her diganosis, she was observed to 
cough occasionally for no obvious reason and appeared to
have some movement issues. X-ray confirmed tumours likely
responsible for both problems.   

Her copper supplementation was fairly minimal but given her
overall state of health and pregnancy she may be
an interesting case for context.  As the role of copper in cancer
progression is not clear, her tumors  may also be a concern. 


\subsection{Happy}

\mjmhappycu

Happy arrived here in September 2018 heartworm positive.
Her coughing was elimianted for a few weeks in 2019 and
since then it has been coming and going to varying degrees.
Over the years, she has experienced brief periods of sickness
but generally been active and apparently healthy except for the cough.
She has shown  radioagraphic evidence of enlarged heart and possibly narrow
trachea.   
Her heartworm recovery was described
with vitamin K and other supplements
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2019-001-.1li}
followed by an unusual episode which resulted in some
investigation of possible role of vitamins B-2 and B-3
in her health
\cite{marchywka-MJM-2022-009-0.50rg}
.
She had two episodes resulting in emergency vet visits
and blood work. On 2022-02-02 lab resuls were notable for
elevated creatine kinase( 609U/L, 10-200) 
slightly high glucose ( 123mg/dL, 63-114) , low normal Ca
( 8.5 mg/dl, 8.4-11.8)  and Cl ( 108mmol/L, 108-119)
with high normal bicarbonate( 26mmol/L, 13-27). 
ALP( 35 U/L, 5-160 ) was normal
and total T4 low normal ( 1.2mug/dL , 1.0-4.0 ). 
On 2024-10-04 at a different clinic glucose was normal
( 111mg/dL, 70-143) and ALP was low normal ( 31U/L, 23-212)
with no measures of creatine kinase or blood chemistry.
The change in ALP appears to be largely due to reference ranges
as numbers are similar between visits. 
For comparison, Little Man on 2016-12-29 while on steroids
IIRC had elevated ALP ( 231 U/L, 0-140 )i and high
glucose (126ml/dL, 75-124) and low BUN ( 8.6 mg/dl, 9-29).
ALP may have been elevated due to steroids as well as copper
toxicity. 

Happy also had episodes of "flopping"  as if trying to scratch
back on furniture or floor. When first noted circa 2019-08-27(18135)
it was treated successfully with Apoquel. Subsequently it would
come and go but was generally not bad enough to treat.
 

\mjmtol{
Happy, like Brownie, was also the subject of two prior works.
Initially her heartworm recovery was described
with vitamin K and other supplements
\cite{mmarchywka-MJM-2019-001-.1li}
followed by an unusual episode which resulted in some
investigation of possible role of vitamins B-2 and B-3
in her health
\cite{marchywka-MJM-2022-009-0.50rg}
.
To summarize, Happy arrived heartworm positive coughing to varying degrees.
She was treated with a slow kill approach including ivermectin
and doxycycline as previously described. Years  later she was acting
sick but appeared to recover well with B vitamin supplements.
Her coughing never returned to the very low levels
seen after heartworm recovery until copper doses were increased
with elimination of any zinc and care with tryptophan.
}


As copper was increased due to widespread coughing after Trixie's
arrival, her cough was noted to decrease to lower than prior levels.
Review of the copper dosing suggested it had fallen prior to Trixie's
arrival.
Often her excited cough appeared to be a honk on exhale suggestive of
trachea collapse. She also would cough early in the morning
when curled up. 
As outlined in the introductiory material, it was later realized 
that earlier conserns about aromatic amino acids could be
due to simple excitability rather than any disease worsening.
This most recent effort considered some coughing increase normal
and now she seems to have reduced coughing, good energy level,
and maybe some  aromatic amino acid sensitivity. 

During the increased copper interval it was noted that
her frantic "rubbing", where she tries to rub her lower
back on fucniture or rolled over on the floor,
had stopped. This was most severe years ago when it
was treated successfully with Apoquel between 2019-08-27
and 2019-11-03. After that, it had come and gone but never
appeared distressing enough to treat again. A review of the
copper and zinc dosing during the Apoquel treated spell
suggests very low copper ( maybe less than 1mg per day )
and substantial zinc ( 3mg on some days). The resolution
with either copper of Apoquel points to the possibility of
a pathogen involvement as will be discussed with Trixie
and Annie's coat problems. 

Currently
she is coughing when excited, now several days after   significant
aromatic supplementation, but her exercize capacity from
jumping during dinner to trotting in the bark is very good.
It remains to be seen if continued copper supplementation can
eliminate the cough presumed due to defects or limitations in 
trachea properties.  

For Happy copper may be necessary but not sufficient. 
Current concern is around restriction of aromatic amino
acids, notably tryptophan, iodine, and iron, along with
adequate meat fats from beef, turykey, and chicken. 

She was coughing a lot while on the presumed optimal
copper and fat diet for several weeks into August
2024 although with no evidence of cardiovascular
limitions to her activity. Generally good in the park
it may be a houshold respiratory irritant  as she
may stop coughing when barking for a while  sucj as before
dinner although then coughing after dinner while quieter
but anticipating left overs. 

On 2024-10-04 Happy went to emergency vet due to stumbling.
Vet found sore spot on spine suggesting it was an injury
but not obvbious in X-ray. Also noted enlarged heart and presribed
standard assortment of enalapril, vetmeden, furosemide. Only the
pain and inflammation drugs were given briefly. Lab work 
demonstrated all normal results and notably ALP was at very
low of range and glucose was near mid range despite having
been high in the past.  These results suggest no copper
toxicity making it possible that her coughing is still
due to insufficient cardiac or tracheal copper. However, the
reason for the low copper levels may need to be determined.
LittkeMan had fairly high ALP when he was no longer coughing.
Happy's apparent copper deficiency may be due to overall diet,
GI chemistry quirks, or progressive diease specific to copper
deployment.

\mjmhappymisc

\mjmtolx{
Also since starting the increased copper she does not appear to
have disruptive itching around her tail area. 
Prior rubbing episodes, treated with Apoquel, did not appear
after increasing copper. This suggests pathogenesis via 
immune response to either allergen or actual patogen 
that becomes resolving with more copper although symptoms
could be treated with Apoquel known and likely side effects
make this a cleaner solution. 
}


\subsection{Trixie}

\mjmtrixiecu

Trixie began coughing shortly after arrival and was
very low energy. Her coat was notable for a sticky
feeling that seemeed to recur after a bath.  
Many other dogs began to cough or
hack suggesting that she brought a communicable infectious
disease which was the motivation for increasing copper again. 
Nutrient mix was modified to add more copper and
most dogs' coughing returned to normal quanity and qualitiy
although her's did not entirely resolve. Copper stopped for a couple
day ( I was gone ) and owner took he to the vet as she
began coughing more. Clavamox was prescribed and her coughing
stopped within a few days. Her energy level has improved
but she did not  run until 2024-05-02 ( 19845 ) .  
She had a renwed cough around 2024-05-22 (19865)  subsequent to
copper withdrawl on 2024-05-15 (19858). 
Cough seems deep on excitement not honk/wheeze like Happy.
Copper resumed 2024-05-27 and is greatly reduced
by 2025-06-01 . 
She appeared more energetic than when I left and walked well
although maybe still tired at end of walk. 
Her coat now feels clean. 

Most recently she has been getting more complete supplementation
including tryptophan and tyrosine with iron and lipoicacid
and continues to gain energy. Coughing is very rare and her mobility
seems ok not hesitating as much to run or jump a little.  

\subsection{Rocky}

\mjmrockycu

\mjmrockyi

Rocky arrive here on 2022-02-05 in generally good condition
although notable for a "rubber block" or "plastic" body type feel.
Notes on his condition including cough were sparse although
he tended to stay covered up on the couch a lot as other small
dogs tend to do. 
Rocky will hopefully be the subject of another work as
he responded significantly to iodine and sodium benzoate
which was attributed to, but never lab confirmed, low
thyroid output. His "plastic" body type changed into
a more normal "flexible" type and he began to feel like 
the other dogs when picked up rather than stiff.
The addition of copper may have reduced his morning cough
but he continued to have apparent congestion after eating
sometimes breathing through his mouth and sneezing.
That too has cleared up by 2024-06-01.
Most recently he had notable muscle tone which had been lacking.
His overall activity increased but that may be due to social factors
such as feeding ritual. 
Some coughing now coincides with exposure to cigarette smoke.


Copper was shown to correlate negatively with TSH
in one human study and may increase T4 levels 
\cite{10.3389/fendo.2023.1134208}.


As benzoate may be an important coundounding factor,
a brief digression here may be helpful. 
A recent study on rats fed benzoate demonstrated
some insignificant indication of increased T4 and decreased
TSH which the authors summarize as,
\cite{TURNBULL2021104897}
,
\begin{quote}
Minor variations in T4 and TSH levels were not considered treatment-related because they were not noted in a dose responsive manner, were not generally statistically significant, or were observed in a direction that would be generally not be considered toxicologically relevant. These minor variations also fell within the range of levels noted for historical controls."
\end{quote}

If there is a beneficial effect, it likely depends on many factors
such as overall diet and may vary across species.


\subsection{Annie}

\mjmanniecu

Annie probably showed the clearest improvement
coincident with increased copper ( and a few other components
described below)  on two occasions. 
Annie arrived  thin but in generally good condition although 
seemed old for stated age of 6 years
. She ate well
but had some limitations in sight and hearing. She
seemed to get skin or paw irritations easily.
Coughing was variable and not well documented.
She feels a little "frail."
She began to sleep excessively in early 2024 
and a  special copper snack was started on 2024-05-01 ( 19844).
This consisted of 2mg of copper along with sodium benzoate, KCl,
and B-6 in chicken broth which was more readily accepted than the 
full snacks for everyone else. 
As these other components had been quite common they were not
considered significant although the sodium benzoate had also been 
stopped earlier. 
Lost vigor suddently regained in a few days
and seemed restored to her more typical self by
 2024-05-05 ( 10948 ) with continuing improvements in 
energy and appetite.
 % of 2mg cu. 
Her exercise interest improved and she walked and cried
with good energy. 
%Panting up hill at park but quite active again. 
%Started special copper snack on 2024-05-01 ( 19844)

Around 2024-10-11 ( 20007 )  Annie was noted to have swelling under her
left eye. As she had not been eating the PMSNACK regularly her
copper intake had again been reduced so I added it alone to 
canned dog food which she ate well. By her vet visit 3 days
later on Monday, the swelling was gone.  
She was prescribed Clavamox and an "artificial tear" solution.

She generally have a preference for marrow, some amino acids
( tryptophan, tyrosine, methionine), and iron and some
for benzoate.  

\subsection{Hershey}

In retrospect, Hershey should have been an important clue
as he reacted quickly to the copper but there was undue concern
for increased coughing.

\mjmhersheycu

\mjmhersheytable


Hershey quickly demonstrated several problems not long after arrival.
He had problems with his fur, digestion, and coughing while ultimately
being diagnosed with heart failure and bladder stones.
During his time here, his diet was varied and he was observed
for overall eating and bahvior with specific interest in 
coughing and ability to make it up a short flight of steps
from the backyard to the deck. Again, the notes were not sufficient
to fully captures the dynamics of his condition but some representative
ones have been edited into the above list. Some correspondence with
copper intake is noted. In the last few days of his life, he
would pass out and quickly regain consciousness until one day 
he did not recover presumably due to heart failure. 
As many initial features could be rationalized as related to thyroid output,
his iodine intake was elevated. 
In tretropsect, his initial response to increased copper may have been
to be more energetic but that increased his coughing leading
to a dosage reduction. Clearly the data are incomplete but suggestive
now of some benefits. 


\mjmtolx{
\subsection{Miscellaneous Observations}
Rocky seemed to do better but had  also been responding
to benzoate and iodine. Ultimately the iron addition may have
improved his energy the most.  

In initial attempts to formulate a vitamin mix,
copper was added but no zinc. There was some possible
feeding hesitance that went away when zinc was added.
However a causal link was not established although 
copper was moderated afterwards. Annie may lose
some appetite with excessive copper. However, a
causal link was not eastablished. 

In a quick review of blood tests, 
chloride tended to be low and bicarbonate high.
}

\section{Discussion }


Copper supplementation averaging around .2 to as high 
as .8 mg/kgBW/day appeared beneficial in this group of
dogs as symptom improvement often followed weeks of dosing.
In the case of Annie, two results appeared just a couple
days after copper intake was increased. 
Several suspicious observations were noted but nothing
robustly correlated with copper intake. 
As some symptoms such as coughing are the product
of many factors, interpretation is difficult during the 
initial response phase. Most notably, increased general
energy may increase coughing in the presence of a weak
or collapsed trachea or with some heart conditions. 
Initial response would be to increased energy production
and persumably a feeling of wellbeing but remodelling
and stiffening 
may take longer to  achieve  more complete  
resolution. Another difficulty is  due to pulsed dosing.
This was chosen to allow rotation of various
nutrients and make it easier to see short term effects
of comparatively high doses. However, it did require 
that time series be averaged  for analysis.
Happy's copper intake dropped much lower than normal
preceeding a period of excessive coughing. It was only
after copper was started due to Trixie's  respiratory infection
that the data were examined more carefully and the pattern
noted. Ideally the filtering would be a lagging average
weighted to some suspected biological parameters but
even uniform moving average was useful.   

Atempts to standardize the vitamins and split one snack
for everyone often resulted in reduced copper
supplementation for some of the dogs who needed it.
The afternoon snack was used for the daily copper 
but it was not as well accepted as the morning snack.
Special snacks with copper or other isolated nutrients
in canned food worked for individual dogs. 


At least in one dog, Happy, copper was required to conol
coughing but it did not work in the context of a low fat
diet and may also be limited by zinc, iron, or cherries
that contain fructose.  The search for suspected diet link to
DCM in dogs may want to consider copper availability as an
issue and ingredients such as these as possible problems.


The overall concern with Happy and aromatic amino acids
ist still not clear. Increased energy may lead to more
coughing but 
pulmonary hypertension may be controlled by serotonin
\cite{PMID27927914} and therefore tryptophan intake. 
Pulmonary hypertension is itself pathological and
should be avoided while increased arousal state would
be important for quality of life so investigation may be useful. 


Happy's prior rubbing episodes, initially treated with Apoquel but 
subsequently just "waited out" , did not appear
after increasing copper even though she had been doing that on and
off recently. This "allergy" could be  pathogenic via 
immune response to either allergen or actual patogen 
that becomes resolving with more copper although symptoms
could be treated with Apoquel known and likely side effects
make this a cleaner solution. 

Reconciliation with various concerns and failures
relies on the complex interaction with other dietary componets
which may be important over a large range of genetics. 
Copper was just one of many nutrients explored and
it requires some of these for proper handling.
Any optimization strategy would need to conintually
be finding the performance limiting nutrient
in turn as each is tweaked. 


Hypothyroidism is common but may be due to a nutrient
deficiency suzh as iodine or less obviously copper.
Some of the symptoms associated with hypothyroidism
could be explained by copper deficiency alone.
The role of sodium benzoate may be important but
difficult to characterize  but may be a topic of a later
work on Rocky.

Copper was considered to be important early but despite
some successes was lost in the shuffle. While the conditions
for benehficial usage remain unknown, several suspects
can be identified. Histidine addition was the most
obviously correlated with increased
alertness, animation, and aggression although there
may have been some expectation bias considering increased
histamine contributint to these states. These responses
could increase coughing leading to the erroneous
conclusions it was making something worse.    

\mjmtol{ repeated in intro }
Besides the mulecules althready mentioned, it is worth
noting that taurine was a consistent dietary component.
Sulfates are observed to create copper deficiency in ruminants
and the possibility exists that taurine exhibits related chemisty
in the GI tract. Indeed, it has been observed to reduce
copper toxicity in rats with increased feacal copper
amounts \cite{PMID9609396} suggesting decreased
absorption. 
Another work demonstrated taurine reduced ceruloplasmin only
in rats fed a  control diet but not a high-fat diet
\cite{Krol2020}.
As taurine is being explored for various indications,
including DCM \cite{PMC9257265},
apaprent limitations in supplementation could  related
to induced copper defieincy which would likely cause some
symptoms expectedd of copper defieincy.


Several likely benefits of copper suypplementation were observed
but no clear robust clinical symptoms got worse.
This is contrary to some indications from populat concerns
about excessive copper in commercial dog foods. 
Copper use requires uptake and transportation to 
various targets. Transport out of the liver can be hindered
for reasons such as ceruloplasmin defects.

Coughing and other subjective signs were often used
to monitor progress and notes were not always sufficient.
Coughing as described before can be produced by many
causes. Here, we were concerned mostly with infection,
trachea collapse, and heart enlargement. Honking
related to trachea collapse may be more common when the
dog is excited. In this case, improving "energy" may
produce more coughing even though the dog is largely
healthier but the heart is still large or trachea
still soft. This is further complicated with additions
of vitamins that tend to promote alertness as was 
observed with histidine ( indeed there was some concern
about aggression when initiating it ). This may not
have been fully appreciated early on.  


B-6 deficiency has been linked to excess copper excretion \cite{PMID7814236}
possibly making copper a secondary excretion issue
rather than a primary absorption problem. 
However, the concern with excess B-6 intake creating effective
deficiency is a reminder to look more carefully at all data. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% cutoff

Iver a broad range of genetics, its likely that copper intake
can be raised as long as other nutirents are also given
to handle the copper beneficially.
Candidate nutrients include tryrosine and tryptophan.

\section{Limitations}
While the other components were mentioned as important,
it needs to be reiterated that the 
the other snack components could have effected copper handling
significantly and supplementation with another diet lacking
these components may not be beneficiail but copper restriction
may not be either. Most food ingredient interact with matals 
to varying degrees and this notably contained citric acid
and spinach along with amino acids. 

The residential setting made it difficult to control or monitor
all of the factors which could effect health. Besides the main
kibble meals not being recorded for some dogs, intake of food
and foriegn objects was common and unpredictable. 
Supplement quantities were often measured by volume using kitchen
utensils known to be poorly calibrated. 
Completely unknown experiences or factors may be involved in their
subjective behaviors.  Cigarette smoke exposure was common
but variable.
As is always the case, despite MUQED's ability to keep strcutured
outcome notes on things like cough, the resulting outcome
data was very sparse and relies on memory in some cases.
The lesson remains that notes and data always need to be
more complete. 



\section{Conclusions}


Copper supplementation circa .3-1mg/kgBW for this group of dogs
did not appear to generate any adverse events with the possible
exception of Dexter who was never dosed consistently. 
Responses observed included increased energy level and  reduced 
infection symptoms.
The main goal of eliminating Happy's
cough was not achieved with the final diet although her ALP
remains low suggesting she may benefit from even more copper
due to either worsening disease or some quirks of the current diet.

Copper availability may depend on stomach pH and other dietary
components such as sulfur or zinc. As the pH is reduced the effect of
other components may be reduced. Overall distribution in the body
may also depend on a variety of other nutirents. 

While the above quirks may create an isolated copper specific deficiency,
in general with GI impairments common in old age other nutrients
are likely needed too to see significant benefit.

Copper is widely distributed according to many signals and
a good status indicator would have to be a large vector.
Adaptations to copper imbalance may obscure the underlying problem
motivating an interest in treating symptoms. With concerns about
safety and no easy way to verify deficiency as a cause there may
be hesitancy to add copper to a diet for such unrelated conditions
as heart or thyroid diseases.  This decision tree may 
require futher exploration. 


Concerns about excess accumulation may be due to other dietary defects
and not copper content per se. 

\mjmtolx{
Copper has to be suspected of being important in dogs for 
functions that likely
include strengthening  of structural elements such as the trachea,
volumetric energy effeiciency of the heart, and infection control.
In the GI tract, it may moderate pathogenic phenotypes and
change community structure of microbiome. 
Accumulation in the liver may reflect export problems
rather than too much intake as signalling exists to
regulate uptake and disposal. Defects may be due to other nutrients
and particularly anything that interfers with ceruloplasmin 
synthesis or quality. 

Internal transport and uptake however may both rely on 
GI defects which limit nutrient avialbility. Low stomach
acid may be one common problem. 

Zinc excess may also interfer with copper
deployment.
Dog genetics are varied and specifics likely vary too.
Similar considerations may apply to humans. 

A combination of diatary and digestive quirks may determine
overall copper uptake as well as uptake of other nutrients
needed to insure useful copper distribution. It will be important
to control all factors to get reproducible results. 

Liver pathology that includes atypical amounts of copper
may not reflect excess dietary intake but some other problem
that needs to be fixed including low iron availability.

\section{Supplemental Information}

Dog diet data files are available online at
{\url{https://github.com/mmarchywka/dogdata}}
or other locations as may be required.
The author may also be contacted if onlines sources are not
avialble. Raw MUQED format as well as parsed text formats
are avilable although MUQED software availbility is in the works.


\subsection{Computer Code}
note anything using "snacks\_Collated.ssv" is obsolete as it messed
up adjectives etc. use "linc\_graph -dt-mo"
NB : the "datealias" entries need to be updated not just datemin and datemax
and the latter may not even do anything lol.  A note also
"reporting units" for many new nouns are not right as tsp
 has replaced mg etc. 

\begin{lstlisting}

\section{ Statement of Conflicts }
 No specific funding was used in this effort and there are no relationships
with others that could create a conflict of interest. I would like to develop
these ideas further and have obvious bias towards making them appear 
successful. Barbara Cade, the dog owner, has worked in the pet food industry
but this does not likely create a conflict. We have no interest in the
makers of any of the products named in this work.

\section{About the Authors and Facility}
This work was performed at a dog rescue run by Barbara Cade and
housed in rural Georgia.  The author of this report 
,Mike Marchywka,
has a background in electrical engineering and 
has done extensive research using free online literature sources.  
I hope to find additional people interested in critically 
examining the results and verify that they can be reproduced
effectively to treat other dogs.

\section{Some Common Logical Fallacies and Misdirections}
\label{appendix:errors}

The analysis errors that confuse the problem with the
solution may be catagorized in a number of way but
consider the following possibilities. No attempt is made
to organize, catagorize, or make entries "orthogonal"
as its unclear how or why to do that right now.  

\newcommand{\myitem}[2]{\item {\bf #1 : } #2 \par}
\begin{enumerate}
\myitem{people over data} { Thjis comes up in essays on long lived metdical myths. Opinions, votes, don't determine natural laws }
\myitem{supply v demand}{ An excess quantity is not inherently due to either supply or demand }
\myitem{false dichotomy}{ good and evil  }
\myitem{non-monotonic curves }{ \mjmquote{ show me a monotonic dose response curve and I'll show you a fool } }
\myitem{fix or remove }{ Often there are 2 approaches to getting the same result with a partially broken system.  }
\myitem{one extreme says nothing about the other  }{ Both invcreasing or decreasing some quantity may produce the same ( beneficial or evil ) effect.  }
\myitem{presumed antagonists may work together  }{ One example cited osteoclast activation as not be the opposite osteogensis and in fact vigorous remodelling may be important for healthy bones.   }
\myitem{hidden interaction }{ The observed result requires some interaction partners  }
\myitem{X is a Y   }{ Role confusion leads to more untested assumptions.  }
\myitem{local optimum  }{ prohibits consideration of global optimum over rugged parameter space with bad figure of merit.  }
\myitem{rabbit trail  }{  Successive approcimations, even as advocated in this seris of works, can lead a strategy down the wrong path.  }
\myitem{platitudes  }{ better to be safe than sorry lol   }
\myitem{philosophy over dynamics  }{ feedback can be complicated and commonly observed associations misleading    }
\myitem{equations  }{ consider spherical horse linear approx   }
\myitem{proxies   }{ Almost only counts in horseshoes and handgrenades   }
\myitem{models   }{ This usually means cause and effect is tossed out and the premise of the work has nothing to do with the premise of the real disease and that is often not even known well.   }
\myitem{only relies on  empirical obervations  }{ no cuase and effect stablished   }
\myitem{ignoring empirical obervations  }{ "sanity  check " Theory based on incomplete system topology needs to be consistent with empirical observations  }
\myitem{ignoring  empirical obervations  }{ Theory based on incomplete system topology needs to be consistent with empirical observations  }
\myitem{other state variables }{ Hidden variables include a limting nutrient that is needed to beneficially use the entity under test.   }
\myitem{regulatory landscape }{ As life is generally robust control systems have evolved but may have non-obvious failure modes. }
\myitem{trying harder  }{ If a prefered response is frustrated in attaining a survival relevant goal, there may be signals to try a less orderly response more vigorously. The disorganized response can be suppressed by enabling the effective one.  }
\myitem{narrow corridor }{  Given host-other evolution, you could expect dose response curves with many features but more likely a tight tolerance means that the approach is missing something more robust.  }

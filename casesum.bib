abstract ={Garlic belongs to the Allium family of plants that produce
 organosulfur compounds, such as allicin and diallyl disulfide (DADS), 
which account for their pungency and spicy aroma. Many health benefits
 have been ascribed to Allium extracts, including hypotensive and
 vasorelaxant activities. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying
 these effects remain unknown. Intriguingly, allicin and DADS share 
structural similarities with allyl isothiocyanate, the pungent ingredient
 in wasabi and other mustard plants that induces pain and inflammation by
 activating TRPA1, an excitatory ion channel on primary sensory neurons of
 the pain pathway. Here we show that allicin and DADS excite an allyl
 isothiocyanate-sensitive subpopulation of sensory neurons and induce 
vasodilation by activating capsaicin-sensitive perivascular sensory 
nerve endings. Moreover, allicin and DADS activate the cloned TRPA1 
channel when expressed in heterologous systems. These and other results
 suggest that garlic excites sensory neurons primarily through activation 
of TRPA1. Thus different plant genera, including Allium and Brassica, 
have developed evolutionary convergent strategies that target 
TRPA1 channels on sensory nerve endings to achieve chemical deterrence.},

 abstract = {Steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) and its murine ortholog, pregnane X receptor (PXR), are nuclear receptors that are expressed at high levels in the liver and the intestine where they function as xenobiotic sensors that induce expression of genes involved in detoxification and drug excretion. Recent evidence showed that SXR and PXR are also expressed in bone tissue where they mediate bone metabolism. Here we report that systemic deletion of PXR results in aging-dependent wearing of articular cartilage of knee joints. Histomorphometrical analysis showed remarkable reduction of width and an enlarged gap between femoral and tibial articular cartilage in PXR knockout mice. We hypothesized that genes induced by SXR in chondrocytes have a protective effect on articular cartilage and identified Fam20a (family with sequence similarity 20a) as an SXR-dependent gene induced by the known SXR ligands, rifampicin and vitamin K2. Lastly, we demonstrated the biological significance of Fam20a expression in chondrocytes by evaluating osteoarthritis-related gene expression of primary articular chondrocytes. Consistent with epidemiological findings, our results indicate that SXR/PXR protects against aging-dependent wearing of articular cartilage and that ligands for SXR/PXR have potential role in preventing osteoarthritis caused by aging.},

abstract="Hereditary forms of copper toxicosis exist in man and dogs. In man, Wilson's disease is the best studied disorder of copper overload, resulting from mutations in the gene coding for the copper transporter ATP7B. Forms of copper toxicosis for which no causal gene is known yet are recognized as well, often in young children. Although advances have been made in unraveling the genetic background of disorders of copper metabolism in man, many questions regarding disease mechanisms and copper homeostasis remain unanswered. Genetic studies in the Bedlington terrier, a dog breed affected with copper toxicosis, identified COMMD1, a gene that was previously unknown to be involved in copper metabolism. Besides the Bedlington terrier, a number of other dog breeds suffer from hereditary copper toxicosis and show similar phenotypes to humans with copper storage disorders. Unlike the heterogeneity of most human populations, the genetic structure within a purebred dog population is homogeneous, which is advantageous for unraveling the molecular genetics of complex diseases. This article reviews the work that has been done on the Bedlington terrier, summarizes what was learned from studies into COMMD1 function, describes hereditary copper toxicosis phenotypes in other dog breeds, and discusses the opportunities for genome-wide association studies on copper toxicosis in the dog to contribute to the understanding of mammalian copper metabolism and copper metabolism disorders in man.",

ABSTRACT = {The occurrence of altered brain glucose metabolism has long been suggested in both diabetes and Alzheimer&rsquo;s diseases. However, the preceding mechanism to altered glucose metabolism has not been well understood. Glucose enters the brain via glucose transporters primarily present at the blood-brain barrier. Any changes in glucose transporter function and expression dramatically affects brain glucose homeostasis and function. In the brains of both diabetic and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease patients, changes in glucose transporter function and expression have been observed, but a possible link between the altered glucose transporter function and disease progress is missing. Future recognition of the role of new glucose transporter isoforms in the brain may provide a better understanding of brain glucose metabolism in normal and disease states. Elucidation of clinical pathological mechanisms related to glucose transport and metabolism may provide common links to the etiology of these two diseases. Considering these facts, in this review we provide a current understanding of the vital roles of a variety of glucose transporters in the normal, diabetic and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease brain.},

abstract ={The human Na+/multivitamin transporter (hSMVT) has been suggested to transport alpha-lipoic acid (LA), a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent used in therapeutic applications, e.g. in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and Alzheimer disease. However, the molecular basis of the cellular delivery of LA and in particular the stereospecificity of the transport process are not well understood. Here, we expressed recombinant hSMVT in Pichia pastoris and used affinity chromatography to purify the detergent-solubilized protein followed by reconstitution of hSMVT in lipid bilayers. Using a combined approach encompassing radiolabeled LA transport and equilibrium binding studies in conjunction with the stabilized R-(+)- and S-(−)-enantiomers and the R,S-(+/−) racemic mixture of LA or lipoamide, we identified the biologically active form of LA, R-LA, to be the physiological substrate of hSMVT. Interaction of R-LA with hSMVT is strictly dependent on Na+. Under equilibrium conditions, hSMVT can simultaneously bind ∼2 molecules of R-LA in a biphasic binding isotherm with dissociation constants (Kd) of 0.9 and 7.4 μm. Transport of R-LA in the oocyte and reconstituted system is exclusively dependent on Na+ and exhibits an affinity of ∼3 μm. Measuring transport with known amounts of protein in proteoliposomes containing hSMVT in outside-out orientation yielded a catalytic turnover number (kcat) of about 1 s−1, a value that is well in agreement with other Na+-coupled transporters. Our data suggest that hSMVT-mediated transport is highly specific for R-LA at our tested concentration range, a finding with wide ramifications for the use of LA in therapeutic applications.},

 abstract = {Astrocytes play critical roles in central nervous system homeostasis and support of neuronal function. A better knowledge of their response may both help understand the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and implement new therapeutic strategies. We used the 5xFAD transgenic mouse model of AD (Tg thereafter) to generate astrocyte cultures and investigate the impact of the genotype on metabolic changes and astrocytes activation. Metabolomic analysis showed that Tg astrocytes exhibited changes in the glycolytic pathway and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, compared to wild type (WT) cells. Tg astrocytes displayed also a prominent basal inflammatory status, with accentuated reactivity and increased expression of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). Compensatory mechanisms were activated in Tg astrocytes, including: i) the hexose monophosphate shunt with the consequent production of reducing species; ii) the induction of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), known to protect against amyloid-β (Aβ) toxicity. Such events were associated with the expression by Tg astrocytes of human isoforms of both amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS1). Similar metabolic and inflammatory changes were induced in WT astrocytes by exogenous Aβ peptide. Pantethine, the vitamin B5 precursor, known to be neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory, alleviated the pathological pattern in Tg astrocytes as well as WT astrocytes treated with Aß. In conclusion, our data enlighten the dual pathogenic/protective role of astrocytes in AD pathology and the potential protective role of pantethine.},

We review coccolithophorid evolutionary history and cell biology as well as insights from recent experiments to provide a critical assessment of the costs and benefits of calcification. We conclude that calcification has high energy demands and that coccolithophores might have calcified initially to reduce grazing pressure but that additional benefits such as protection from photodamage and viral/bacterial attack further explain their high diversity and broad spectrum ecology. The cost-benefit aspect of these traits is illustrated by novel ecosystem modeling, although conclusive observations remain limited. In the future ocean, the trade-off between changing ecological and physiological costs of calcification and their benefits will ultimately decide how this important group is affected by ocean acidification and global warming.},

abstract = "Abstract Studies have shown that modification of critical cysteine residues in proteins leads to the regulation of protein function. These modifications include disulfide bond formation, glutathionylation, sulfenic and sulfinic acid formation, and S-nitrosation. The biotin switch assay was developed to specifically detect protein S-nitrosation (S. R. Jaffrey et al., Nat. Cell Biol. 3:193–197; 2001). In this assay, proteins are denatured with \{SDS\} in the presence of methyl methane thiosulfonate (MMTS) to block free thiols. After acetone precipitation or Sephadex \{G25\} separation to remove excess MMTS, HPDP–biotin and 1 mM ascorbate are added to reduce the S-nitrosothiol bonds and label the reduced thiols with biotin. The proteins are then separated by nonreducing \{SDS\} \{PAGE\} and detected using either streptavidin–HRP or anti-biotin–HRP conjugate. Our examination of this labeling scheme has revealed that the extent of labeling depends on the buffer composition and, importantly, on the choice of metal-ion chelator (DTPA vs EDTA). Unexpectedly, using purified S-nitrosated albumin, we have found that “contaminating” copper is required for the ascorbate-dependent degradation of S-nitrosothiol; this is consistent with the fact that ascorbate itself does not rapidly reduce S-nitrosothiols. Removal of copper from buffers by \{DTPA\} and other copper chelators preserves approximately 90% of the S-nitrosothiol, whereas the inclusion of copper and ascorbate completely eliminates the S-nitrosothiol in the preparation and increases the specific biotin labeling. These biotin switch experiments were confirmed using triiodide-based and copper-based reductive chemiluminescence. Additional modifications of the assay using N-ethylmaleimide for thiol blockade, ferricyanide pretreatment to stabilize S-nitrosated hemoglobin, and cyanine dye labeling instead of biotin are presented for the measurement of cellular and blood S-nitrosothiols. These results indicate that degradation of S-nitrosothiol in the standard biotin switch assay is metal-ion dependent and that experimental variability in S-nitrosothiol yields using this assay occurs secondary to the inclusion of metal-ion chelators in reagents and variable metal-ion contamination of buffers and labware. The addition of copper to ascorbate allows for a simple assay modification that dramatically increases sensitivity while maintaining specificity. "

abstract ={Members of the twin Cx9C protein family constitute the largest group of proteins in the intermembrane space (IMS) of mitochondria. Despite their conserved nature and their essential role in the biogenesis of the respiratory chain, the molecular function of twin Cx9C proteins is largely unknown. We performed a SILAC-based quantitative proteomic analysis to identify interaction partners of the conserved twin Cx9C protein Cox19. We found that Cox19 interacts in a dynamic manner with Cox11, a copper transfer protein that facilitates metalation of the Cu(B) center of subunit 1 of cytochrome c oxidase. The interaction with Cox11 is critical for the stable accumulation of Cox19 in mitochondria. Cox19 consists of a helical hairpin structure that forms a hydrophobic surface characterized by two highly conserved tyrosine-leucine dipeptides. These residues are essential for Cox19 function and its specific binding to a cysteine-containing sequence in Cox11. Our observations suggest that an oxidative modification of this cysteine residue of Cox11 stimulates Cox19 binding, pointing to a redox-regulated interplay of Cox19 and Cox11 that is critical for copper transfer in the IMS and thus for biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase.},

abstract ={A commonly used method to cause iron loading in rodents is feeding of a 1–2% carbonyl iron diet. This high amount of dietary iron presumably bypasses normal protective mechanisms and leads to increased body iron levels. We utilized this dietary iron-overload model in a mouse feeding study in which we also altered the dietary copper content. This study was intended to test the hypothesis that dietary copper would influence intestinal iron absorption during iron overload. Weanling, male C57BL/6 mice were housed in overhanging, wire mesh-bottomed cages and fed one of 6 different AIN-93G-based diets for 4 weeks containing normal (79 ppm) or high (8820 ppm) iron in combination with low (0.9 ppm), normal (8 ppm) or high (183 ppm) copper. Diets were otherwise identical. All data reported below were from 4–8 mice per group and all reached statistical significance (p<0.05; 2–factor ANOVA). To our surprise, mice fed the high-iron diets with low and normal copper levels grew slower and were severely anemic, but the higher copper content normalized growth rate and corrected the anemia. Transferrin saturation, hepatic non-heme iron content, and hepatic hepcidin mRNA expression were all uniformly elevated in all groups of mice fed the high-iron diets. We also noted decreased heart copper content and cardiac hypertrophy in the mice fed the high-iron diet with low and normal copper, but the high-copper diet corrected this defect. Moreover, hepatic copper content was lower and serum ceruloplasmin activity was depressed in the high-iron fed mice with the low and normal copper content, but both were restored to control levels in the group fed the high-iron diet with high copper. These findings suggested that the high dietary iron intake with low and normal copper caused severe copper-deficiency anemia. We postulated that the high-iron content blocked intestinal copper absorption, which then resulted in systemic copper deficiency. We thus tested this hypothesis by performing in vivo intestinal copper absorption studies. Mice were again fed the same diets for 4 weeks, fasted overnight and 64Cu was then administered to the mice by oral gavage. Mice were immediately given ad libitum access to the same diets and then sacrificed ~8 hours later. This time point ensured that no copper was excreted in the feces since transit time in mice is ~11 hours. This is important since copper can be excreted in the bile via the feces. Copper absorption was calculated as a ratio of counts in the carcass (minus the GI tract) to total counts administered by gavage × 100. Results showed that mice fed the low copper, adequate-iron diet had higher copper absorption (>60% of administered dose). Mice fed the low-copper diet with high iron, however, failed to upregulate copper absorption. Further, although mice fed the adequate copper, high-iron diet, suffered from copper-deficiency anemia, they did not have the ability to upregulate copper absorption. Additionally, 64Cu accumulation in all tissues tested was significantly lower than in the low-copper, adequate-iron fed group. Collectively, these data then suggest that high-body iron levels impair intestinal copper absorption and perturb copper distribution, providing further evidence of physiologically relevant iron-copper interactions in mammals.Support or Funding InformationNIH grant 1R01 DK074867 (to J.F.C.)

 abstract = {Background Folklore remedies for pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis include the application of magnets and copper to the skin. Despite the popular use of devices containing magnets or copper for this purpose, little research has been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of such treatments. Objective To investigate whether the practice of wearing magnetic wrists straps, or copper bracelets, offers any specific therapeutic benefit for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Design Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Methods 70 patients, aged 33 to 79 years and predominantly female (n = 52), with painful rheumatoid arthritis were recruited from general practices within Yorkshire. Participants were randomly allocated to wear four devices in a different order. Devices tested were: a standard (1502 to 2365 gauss) magnetic wrist strap, a demagnetised (<20 gauss) wrist strap, an attenuated (250 to 350 gauss) magnetic wrist strap, and a copper bracelet. Devices were each worn for five weeks, with treatment phases being separated by one week wash-out periods. The primary outcome measured was pain using a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Secondary pain measures were the McGill Pain Questionnaire and tender joint count. Inflammation was assessed using C-reactive protein and plasma viscosity blood tests and by swollen joint count. Physical function was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (Disability Index). Disease activity and medication use was also measured. Results 65 participants provided complete self-report outcome data for all devices, four participants provided partial data. Analysis of treatment outcomes did not reveal any statistically significant differences (P>0.05) between the four devices in terms of their effects on pain, inflammation, physical function, disease activity, or medication use. Conclusions Wearing a magnetic wrist strap or a copper bracelet did not appear to have any meaningful therapeutic effect, beyond that of a placebo, for alleviating symptoms and combating disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis.

 abstract = { Spectroscopic studies have been performed to investigate the high-affinity binding site for copper in human serum albumin (HSA) and dog serum albumin (DSA). A new approach based on exposure to albumin of the copper in the form of a well-characterized histidine (his) chelate has been adopted. This technique has been shown to minimize interaction at the lower affinity sites. The analysis of the S-band EPR spectrum of [Cu(his)2] at pH 7.3 revealed the major component is a complex formed with two histidines in a histamine-like coordination. Detailed analysis of S-band and X-band EPR and optical spectra of [Cu(II)−HSA] revealed that copper forms a complex with HSA involving α-NH2 terminal, two deprotonated peptide nitrogens (NH of Ala2, and NH of His3), and the imidazole nitrogen of His3 in a square planar arrangement. The spectral data were found to be independent of pH in the range 4.5−9.0 and did not confirm axial Asp1 carboxylate chelation. The EPR study of [Cu(II)−DSA] complex at pH 7.3 confirmed the presence of two bonded nitrogens which substantiate the absence of strategically located His3. It has been suggested that residues of non-nitrogen origin localized in the main body of DSA may be involved in copper binding, which would explain the protection from the Sanger reaction. }

abstract ={Unlike human serum albumin (HSA), dog serum albumin (DSA) failed to exhibit the characteristics of a specific first binding site for copper(II). Equilibrium dialysis of DSA against Cu(II) at pH 7.5 indicated two preferred Cu(II)-binding sites of comparable affinities. Equilibrium dialysis of HSA and DSA against Cu(II), in the presence of l-histidine as competing ligand, demonstrated the absence in DSA of the first strong binding site apparent in HSA. The addition of 1 eq of Cu(II) to HSA almost quantitatively protected the terminal α-amino group from reacting with dinitrofluorobenzene at pH 11.0, whereas by the same treatment only 32% protection was afforded to DSA. The Cu(II)-binding properties of HSA and DSA were compared by spectrophotometric and proton displacement studies. HSA was found to have those binding features that have been found to characterize bovine serum albumin. Results with DSA in the presence of 1 and 2 eq of Cu(II) strongly suggested the partitioning of the first equivalent of Cu(II) between at least two sites. At basic pH one site would appear to involve the α-amino nitrogen, consistent with the partial protection of DSA in presence of Cu(II) from NH2-terminal modification by dinitrofluorobenzene. The partitioning of the first equivalent of Cu(II) between two sites seems most pronounced near neutral pH. At high pH the site involving the α-amino ligand is apparently somewhat preferred over the other possible loci. Possible explanations for the absence of the specific Cu(II)-binding site in DSA are discussed.},

abstract = "Garlic (Allium sativum), a member of the family Liliaceae, contains an abundance of chemical compounds that have been shown to possess beneficial effects to protect against several diseases, including cancer. Evidence supports the protective effects of garlic in stomach, colorectal, breast cancer in humans. The protective effects appear to be related to the presence of organosulfur compounds, predominantly allyl derivatives, which also have been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis in forestomach, esophagus, colon, mammary gland and lung of experimental animals. The exact mechanisms of the cancer-preventive effects are not clear, although several hypotheses have been proposed. Organosulfur compounds modulate the activity of several metabolizing enzymes that activate (cytochrome P450s) or detoxify (glutathione S-transferases) carcinogens and inhibit the formation of \{DNA\} adducts in several target tissues. Antiproliferative activity has been described in several tumor cell lines, which is possibly mediated by induction of apoptosis and alterations of the cell cycle. Organosulfur compounds in garlic are thus possible cancer-preventive agents. Clinical trials will be required to define the effective dose that has no toxicity in humans. "

Mitochondria from aged tissue use oxygen inefficiently impairing \{ATP\} synthesis and results in increased oxidant production. A high flux of oxidants not only damages mitochondria, but other important cell biomolecules as well. In the present investigation, the levels of lipid peroxidation, oxidized glutathione, non-enzymatic antioxidants and the activities of mitochondrial enzymes were measured in liver and kidney mitochondria of young and aged rats before and after lipoic acid supplementation. In both liver and kidney increase in the levels of mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and oxidized glutathione and decrease in the levels of antioxidants and the activities of mitochondrial enzymes were observed in aged rats. DL-alpha-lipoic acid supplemented aged rats showed a decrease in the levels of lipid peroxidation and oxidized glutathione and increase in the levels of reduced glutathione, vitamins C and E and the activities of mitochondrial enzymes like isocitrate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, NADH-dehydrogenase and cytochrome-c-oxidase. Thus, lipoic acid reverses the age-associated decline in endogenous low molecular weight antioxidants and mitochondrial enzymes and, therefore, may lower the increased risk of oxidative damage that occurs during ageing. From our results it can be concluded that lipoic acid supplementation enhances the activities of mitochondrial enzymes and antioxidant status and thereby protects mitochondria from ageing. "

abstract="Copper deficiency has been reported to be associated withdecreased cytochrome c oxidase activity, whichin turn may be responsible for theobserved mitochondrial impairment and cardiac failure. We isolatedmito-chondriafrom hearts of copper-deficient rats: cytochrome c oxidase activity was found to be lowerthan incopper-adequate mitochondria. The residual activity paralleled coppercontent of mitochondria and also corresponded with the heme amount associated with cytochromeaa3. In fact, lower absorption in thea-band region of cytochrome aa3 was foundfor copper-deficient rat heart mitochondria. Gel electrophoresisof protein extractedfrom mitochondrial membranes allowed measurements of protein content of thecomplexes ofoxidative phosphorylation, revealing a lower content of complex IV protein incopper-deficientrat heart mitochondria. The alterations caused by copper deficiency appear to bespecific forcytochrome c oxidase. Changes were not observed for F 0 F 1 ATP synthase activity,for heme contents ofcytochrome c and b, and for protein contents of complexes I, III and V.The present study demonstrates that the alteration of cytochrome c oxidase activityobserved in copper deficiency is due to a diminishedcontent of assembled protein and that shortnessof copper impairs heme insertion into cytochrome c oxidase.",

 abstract = "The safety of the nation's drinking water must be maintained to ensure the health of the public. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for regulating the levels of substances in the drinking water supply. Copper can leach into drinking water from the pipes in the distribution system, and the allowable levels are regulated by the EPA. The regulation of copper, however, is complicated by the fact that it is both necessary to the normal functioning of the body and toxic to the body at too high a level. \n\nThe National Research Council was requested to form a committee to review the scientific validity of the EPA's maximum contaminant level goal for copper in drinking water. Copper in Drinking Water outlines the findings of the committee's review. The book provides a review of the toxicity of copper as well as a discussion of the essential nature of this metal. The risks posed by both short-term and long-term exposure to copper are characterized, and the implications for public health are discussed. This book is a valuable reference for individuals involved in the regulation of water supplies and individuals interested in issues surrounding this metal. \n",

abstract ={Vitamin K2 is a critical nutrient required for blood coagulation. It also plays a key role in bone homeostasis and is a clinically effective therapeutic agent for osteoporosis. We previously demonstrated that vitamin K2 is a transcriptional regulator of bone marker genes in osteoblastic cells and that it may potentiate bone formation by activating the steroid and xenobiotic receptor, SXR. To explore the SXR-mediated vitamin K2 signaling network in bone homeostasis, we identified genes up-regulated by both vitamin K2 and the prototypical SXR ligand, rifampicin, in osteoblastic cells using oligonucleotide microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Fourteen genes were up-regulated by both ligands. Among these, tsukushi, matrilin-2, and CD14 antigen were shown to be primary SXR target genes. Moreover, collagen accumulation in osteoblastic MG63 cells was enhanced by vitamin K2 treatment. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses showed that the small leucine-rich proteoglycan, tsukushi, contributes to vitamin K2-mediated enhancement of collagen accumulation. Our results suggest a new function for vitamin K2 in bone formation as a transcriptional regulator of extracellular matrix-related genes, that are involved in the collagen assembly.},

It is well-defined as a therapy for preventing diabetic polyneuropathies, and scavenges free radicals, chelates metals, and restores intracellular glutathione levels which otherwise decline with age. How do the biochemical properties of \{LA\} relate to its biological effects? Herein, we review the molecular mechanisms of \{LA\} discovered using cell and animal models, and the effects of \{LA\} on human subjects. Though \{LA\} has long been touted as an antioxidant, it has also been shown to improve glucose and ascorbate handling, increase eNOS activity, activate Phase \{II\} detoxification via the transcription factor Nrf2, and lower expression of MMP-9 and VCAM-1 through repression of NF-kappa B. \{LA\} and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid, may use their chemical properties as a redox couple to alter protein conformations by forming mixed disulfides. Beneficial effects are achieved with low micromolar levels of LA, suggesting that some of its therapeutic potential extends beyond the strict definition of an antioxidant. Current trials are investigating whether these beneficial properties of \{LA\} make it an appropriate treatment not just for diabetes, but also for the prevention of vascular disease, hypertension, and inflammation.

 abstract = { Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) causes a debilitating and potentially fatal illness known as botulism. The toxin is also a bioterrorism threat, yet no pharmacological antagonist to counteract its effects has reached clinical approval. Existing strategies to negate BoNT/A intoxication have looked to antibodies, peptides, or organic small molecules as potential therapeutics. In this work, a departure from the traditional drug discovery mindset was pursued, in which the enzyme’s susceptibility to metal ions was exploited. A screen of a series of metal salts showed marked inhibitory activity of group 11 and 12 metals against the BoNT/A light chain (LC) protease. Enzyme kinetics revealed that copper (I) and (II) cations displayed noncompetitive inhibition of the LC (Ki ≈ 1 μM), while mercury (II) cations were 10-fold more potent. Crystallographic and mutagenesis studies elucidated a key binding interaction between Cys165 on BoNT/A LC and the inhibitory metals. As potential copper prodrugs, ligand-copper complexes were examined in a cell-based model and were found to prevent BoNT/A cleavage of the endogenous protein substrate, SNAP-25, even at low μM concentrations of complexes. Further investigation of the complexes suggested a bioreductive mechanism causing intracellular release of copper, which directly inhibited the BoNT/A protease. In vivo experiments demonstrated that copper (II) dithiocarbamate and bis(thiosemicarbazone) complexes could delay BoNT/A-mediated lethality in a rodent model, indicating their potential for treating the harmful effects of BoNT/A intoxication. Our studies illustrate that metals can be therapeutically viable enzyme inhibitors; moreover, enzymes that share homology with BoNT LCs may be similarly targeted with metals. }

Forty-eight shrimps (L. vannamei) were exposed to a low concentration of copper (1 mg/L; experimental treatment) and forty-eight shrimps were used as controls (no copper added to the water). As a result of this experiment, it was found that shrimps with more copper are significantly redder than those designated as controls (hue (500–700 nm): P = 0.0015; red chroma (625–700 nm): P<0.0001). These results indicate that redder color may result from exposure to copper and challenge the commonly held view that highly pigmented shrimps are healthier than pale shrimps.},

abstract="Pyridoxal phosphate is the cofactor for over 100 enzyme-catalysed reactions in the body, including many involved in the synthesis or catabolism of neurotransmitters. Inadequate levels of pyridoxal phosphate in the brain cause neurological dysfunction, particularly epilepsy. There are several different mechanisms that lead to an increased requirement for pyridoxine and/or pyridoxal phosphate. These include: (i) inborn errors affecting the pathways of B6 vitamer metabolism; (ii) inborn errors that lead to accumulation of small molecules that react with pyridoxal phosphate and inactivate it; (iii) drugs that react with pyridoxal phosphate; (iv) coeliac disease, which is thought to lead to malabsorption of B6 vitamers; (v) renal dialysis, which leads to increased losses of B6 vitamers from the circulation; (vi) drugs that affect the metabolism of B6 vitamers; and (vii) inborn errors affecting specific pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes. The last show a very variable degree of pyridoxine responsiveness, from 90{\%} in X-linked sideroblastic anaemia ($\delta$-aminolevulinate synthase deficiency) through 50{\%} in homocystinuria (cystathionine $\beta$-synthase deficiency) to 5{\%} in ornithinaemia with gyrate atrophy (ornithine $\delta$-aminotransferase deficiency). The possible role of pyridoxal phosphate as a chaperone during folding of nascent enzymes is discussed. High-dose pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate may have deleterious side-effects (particularly peripheral neuropathy with pyridoxine) and this must be considered in treatment regimes. None the less, in some patients, particularly infants with intractable epilepsy, treatment with pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate can be life-saving, and in other infants with inborn errors of metabolism B6 treatment can be extremely beneficial.",

journal="Neurochemical Research",
year="1989",
volume="14",
number="9",
pages="889--897",
abstract="It is well known that a dietary restriction of vitamin B-6 during gestation and lactation produces spontaneous seizures in neonatal animals. Since pyridoxal phosphate, one of the biologically active forms of vitamin B-6, is the cofactor for GAD the neonatal seizures have been attributed to low levels of brain GABA as a result of cofactor depletion. Although GABA levels are significantly lower in B-6 restricted neonatal rats with spontaneous seizures, seizure activity is not present in B-6 deficient adult rats or 28 day old rats in the present study, despite significantly low levels of brain GABA. These facts suggest that depletion of GABA is not the only biochemical alteration essential for the emergence of seizures. In the present study, the effect of vitamin B-6 undernutrition on the concentrations of the neuroactive amino acids, Glu, Gly, Tau, and GABA was determined in selected regions of the developing rat brain. The results show that the concentrations of Glu, Tau, and GABA were significantly lower and GLY significantly higher in selected brain regions of the B-6 restricted 14 day old rat compared to control tissue. Most of these changes were unique to 14 days of age, the time when spontaneous seizures are observed, and not present at 28 or 56 days of age when seizures are absent. This pattern of amino acid changes in the brain and the magnitude of the changes was consistent with those measured in a variety of chemically-induced animal models of epilepsy and in human epileptic foci. The regional distribution of amino acid changes was associated with brain regions which have been suggested to be responsible for the initiation and propagation of seizure activity. Two unique findings were also made in this study. First, there was a regional brain heterogeneity in the age-associated loss of brain Tau concentrations with the pons/medulla and substantia nigra appearing to be highly vulnerable and the hippocampus quite resistant to the loss of Tau. A second finding was the normalization of the neonatal GABA deficit in most brain regions by 56 days of age. The normalization of brain GABA was present in the face of continued dietary vitamin B-6 restriction. In summary, this study shows that the neuroactive amino acids Glu, Gly, Tau, and GABA are markedly altered in the seizure-prone vitamin B-6 restricted neonatal rat brain. The alterations in the brain concentration of Glu, Gly, and Tau may play an equally important role as GABA in the underlying mechanism of seizures associated with this condition.",

In a screen for modifiers of the Parkinson-associated gene, pink1, Vos et al. (p. 1306, published online 10 May; see the Perspective by Bhalerao and Clandinin) identified the fruit fly homolog of UBIAD1, {\textquotedblleft}Heix.{\textquotedblright} UBIAD1 was localized in mitochondria and was able to convert vitamin K1 into vitamin K2/menaquinone (MK-n, n the number of prenylgroups). In bacteria, vitamin K2/MK-n acts as an electron carrier in the membrane and, similarly, in Drosophila, mitochondrial vitamin K2 appeared to act as an electron carrier to facilitate adenosine triphosphate production. Fruit flies that lack heix showed severe mitochondrial defects that could be rescued by administering vitamin K2.Human UBIAD1 localizes to mitochondria and converts vitamin K1 to vitamin K2. Vitamin K2 is best known as a cofactor in blood coagulation, but in bacteria it is a membrane-bound electron carrier. Whether vitamin K2 exerts a similar carrier function in eukaryotic cells is unknown. We identified Drosophila UBIAD1/Heix as a modifier of pink1, a gene mutated in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease that affects mitochondrial function. We found that vitamin K2 was necessary and sufficient to transfer electrons in Drosophila mitochondria. Heix mutants showed severe mitochondrial defects that were rescued by vitamin K2, and, similar to ubiquinone, vitamin K2 transferred electrons in Drosophila mitochondria, resulting in more efficient adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction was rescued by vitamin K2 that serves as a mitochondrial electron carrier, helping to maintain normal ATP production.},

abstract="Recent advances in molecular biology have made possible the identification of genetic defects responsible for Wilson's disease, Indian childhood cirrhosis and copper toxicosis in Long Evans Cinnamon rats, toxic milk mice, and Bedlington terriers. The Wilson's disease gene is localized on human chromosome 13 and codes for ATP7B, a copper transporting P-type ATPase. A genetic defect similar to that of Wilson's disease occurs in Long Evans Cinnamon rats and toxic milk mice. Familial copper storage disorders in Bedlington and West Highland white terriers are associated with early subclinical disease, and copper accumulation with subsequent liver injury culminating in cirrhosis. The canine copper toxicosis locus in Bedlington terriers has been mapped to canine chromosome region CFA 10q26. Recently, a mutated MURR1 gene was discovered in Bedlington terriers affected with the disease. Idiopathic childhood cirrhosis is biochemically similar to copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers, but clinically much more severe. Both conditions are characterized by the absence of neurologic damage and Kayser-Fleisher rings, and normal ceruloplasmin levels. A recent study added North Ronaldsay sheep to the list of promising animal models to study Indian childhood cirrhosis. Morphologic similarities between the two conditions include periportal to panlobular copper retention and liver changes varying from active hepatitis to panlobular pericellular fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Certain copper-associated disorders, such as chronic active hepatitis in Doberman pinschers and Skye terrier hepatitis are characterized by copper retention secondary to the underlying disease, thus resembling primary biliary cirrhosis in humans. Copper-associated liver disease has increasingly being recognized in Dalmatians. Copper-associated liver diseases in Dalmatians and Long Evans Cinnamom rats share many morphologic features. Fulminant hepatic failure in Dalmatians is characterized by high serum activities of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, and severe necrosis of centrilobular areas (periacinar, zone 3) hepatocytes. Macrophages and surviving hepatocytes contain copper-positive material. Liver disease associated with periacinar copper accumulation has also been described in Siamese cats. Many questions regarding copper metabolism in mammals, genetic background, pathogenesis and treatment of copper-associated liver diseases remain to be answered. This review describes the similarities between the clinico-pathological features of spontaneous copper-associated diseases in humans and domestic animals.",

    abstract = { Copper is a ubiquitous trace metal necessary for normal function of a variety of cellular proteins. Intracellular copper metabolism is complex, and only a few of the proteins/genes involved are known. Copper deficiency does not appear to be a clinical problem in dogs. Excess copper accumulation in the liver as a cause of hepatitis and cirrhosis was first demonstrated among Bedlington terriers. Subsequently, copper accumulation in the liver has been shown to occur in several other breeds of dogs. Excess hepatic copper has been found in dogs with normal liver histology, dogs with hepatitis, and dogs with end stage cirrhosis. Evidence is accumulating that copper is a cause of liver disease in breeds of dogs other than Bedlington terriers. Moreover, as more data are accumulated, the copper storage disease appears to have characteristics that are very similar among all of the affected breeds. }

Methods In this retrospective before-after clinical study, we compared the outcome and clinical course of consecutive septic patients treated with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine during a 7-month period (treatment group) with a control group treated in our \{ICU\} during the preceding 7 months. The primary outcome was hospital survival. A propensity score was generated to adjust the primary outcome. Results There were 47 patients in both treatment and control groups, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. The hospital mortality was 8.5% (4 of 47) in the treatment group compared with 40.4% (19 of 47) in the control group (P $<$ .001). The propensity adjusted odds of mortality in the patients treated with the vitamin C protocol was 0.13 (95% CI, 0.04-0.48; P = .002). The Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment score decreased in all patients in the treatment group, with none developing progressive organ failure. All patients in the treatment group were weaned off vasopressors, a mean of 18.3 ± 9.8 h after starting treatment with the vitamin C protocol. The mean duration of vasopressor use was 54.9 ± 28.4 h in the control group (P $<$ .001). Conclusions Our results suggest that the early use of intravenous vitamin C, together with corticosteroids and thiamine, are effective in preventing progressive organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, and in reducing the mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Additional studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings. "

Vitamin K2 is best known as a cofactor in blood coagulation, but in bacteria it is a membrane-bound electron carrier.

We identified Drosophila UBIAD1/Heix as a modifier of pink1, a gene mutated in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease that affects mitochondrial function. Here, we found that vitamin K2 was necessary and sufficient to transfer electrons in Drosophila mitochondria. Heix mutants showed severe mitochondrial defects that were rescued by vitamin K2, and, similar to ubiquinone, vitamin K2 transferred electrons in Drosophila mitochondria, resulting in more efficient adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction was rescued by vitamin K2 that serves as a mitochondrial electron carrier, helping to maintain normal ATP production.},

Homozygous TREM2 missense mutations, such as p.T66M, lead to the FTD-like syndrome, but how they cause pathology is unknown. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we generated a knock-in mouse model for the disease-associated Trem2 p.T66M mutation. Consistent with a loss-of-function mutation, we observe an intracellular accumulation of immature mutant Trem2 and reduced generation of soluble Trem2 similar to patients with the homozygous p.T66M mutation. Trem2 p.T66M knock-in mice show delayed resolution of inflammation upon in~vivo lipopolysaccharide stimulation and cultured macrophages display significantly reduced phagocytic activity. Immunohistochemistry together with in~vivo TSPO small animal positron emission tomography (μPET) demonstrates an age-dependent reduction in microglial activity. Surprisingly, perfusion magnetic resonance imaging and FDG-μPET imaging reveal a significant reduction in cerebral blood flow and brain glucose metabolism. Thus, we demonstrate that a TREM2 loss-of-function mutation causes brain-wide metabolic alterations pointing toward a possible function of microglia in regulating brain glucose metabolism.See also: L Bonanno \&amp; T Wyss-Coray (July 2017)The EMBO Journal (2017) 36: 1837{\textendash}1853},

ABSTRACT = {Feeding pets raw meat-based diets (RMBDs) is commonly practiced by many companion animal owners and has received increasing attention in recent years. It may be beneficial for the animals, but may also pose a health risk for both pets and their owners, as RMBDs may be contaminated by enteric pathogens—such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Yersinia—which are the most common zoonotic bacteria causing enteritis in humans. Little information exists on the prevalence of these pathogens in pet food, and thus one aim was to investigate the prevalence of Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Yersinia in commercial RMBDs from retail stores. Little evidence also exists on the significance of raw meat feeding on the shedding of Campylobacter, Salmonella, and enteropathogenic Yersinia in the feces of pets, and therefore, the second goal was to study the presence of these pathogens in dogs and cats fed RMBDs. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) only sporadically detected Campylobacter, Salmonella, and enteropathogenic Yersinia in RMBDs. These pathogens were not found by culturing, indicating a low contamination level in frozen RMBDs. They were also detected in the feces of dogs and cats, but the association with feeding RMBDs to them remained unclear.},

Among those alterations, inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity, increased free radical production and reduced antioxidant responses have been reported. Copper (Cu) plays an important role in the metabolism and antioxidative responses through its participation as a cofactor in the cytochrome c oxidase enzyme (COX), Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), and metallothioneins. We tested the effect of copper sulfate (CuSO4) pretreatment on the mitochondrial electron transport chain (METC) in the striatum after MPP+ toxicity in rats. The results showed that the MPP+ intrastriatal injection reduced mitochondrial complex I, II, IV and V activities; while 10 μmol of CuSO4 pretreatment counteracted this damage. Activities of complexes I, II and IV, were coincident with ATP recovery. Moreover, Cu/Zn-SOD activity was reduced as a consequence of MPP+ damage; however, copper pre-treatment kept the striatal Cu/Zn-SOD activity unchanged in MPP+-damaged animals. We observed that MPP+ also reduced the metallothionein (MT) content and that CuSO4 pretreatment maintained baseline values. CuSO4 pretreatment also reduced the striatal caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities that were increased three days after MPP+-induced damage. The present study provided evidence that copper pretreatment reduced MPP+-induced apoptotic damage, probably through direct action on copper-dependent proteins or indirectly on proteins in the apoptotic pathway."

abstract = {<jats:p>Senile plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer disease (AD) are primarily composed of the amyloidupbeta (Aupbeta) peptide and contain substantially elevated levels of iron, copper and zinc. These metals bind to Aupbeta and have been reported to increase the toxicity of Aupbeta to cultured neurones. Other reports have demonstrated that Aupbeta can reduce the neurotoxicity of metal ions, suggesting that the interaction can, under some circumstances, be protective. To investigate these apparently conflicting results, human Aupbetai42 was coinjected with iron, copper or zinc (at the concentrations found in plaques) into rat cerebral cortex, and the resulting numbers of dying neurones were compared. It was found that Aupbeta complexed with either iron or zinc was more toxic than Aupbeta alone. In contrast, Aupbetacopper complexes were not neurotoxic. Surprisingly, we observed that when iron or copper were combined with Aupbeta, the neurotoxicity of these metals was substantially reduced, suggesting that Aupbeta may help to limit the toxicity of redoxactive metal ions, thereby assisting the antioxidant defence of the brain. Thus paradoxical effects occur when AP complexes with metal ions, where Aupbetametal complexes are capable of being neurotoxic and neuroprotective.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are prevalent and currently incurable conditions that progressively impair cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric functions of the central or peripheral nervous system. Fibrinogen, a macromolecular glycoprotein, plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response and tissue repair in the human body and interacts with various nervous system cells due to its unique molecular structure. Accumulating evidence suggests that fibrinogen deposits in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. By regulating pathophysiological mechanisms and signaling pathways, fibrinogen can exacerbate the neuro-pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases, while depletion of fibrinogen contributes to the amelioration of cognitive function impairment in patients. This review comprehensively summarizes the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of fibrinogen in central nervous system cells and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Vascular dementia, Huntington's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Additionally, we discuss the potential of fibrinogen-related treatments in the management of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A recent study by Rackaityte et al. reported evidence for a low level of bacterial colonization, specifically of <jats:italic>Micrococcus luteus</jats:italic>, in the intestine of second trimester human fetuses. We have re-analyzed their sequence data and identified a batch effect which violates the underlying assumptions of the bioinformatic method used for contamination removal. This batch effect resulted in <jats:italic>Micrococcus</jats:italic> not being identified as a contaminant in the original work and being falsely assigned to the fetal samples. We further provide evidence that the micrographs presented by Rackaityte et al. are unlikely to show Micrococci or other bacteria as the size of the particles shown exceeds that of related bacterial cells. Finally, phylogenetic analysis showed that the microbes cultured from the fetal samples differed significantly from those detected by sequencing. Overall, our findings show that the presence of <jats:italic>Micrococcus</jats:italic> in the fetal gut is not supported by the primary sequence data. Our findings underline important aspects of the nature of contamination for both sequencing and culture approaches in microbiome studies and the appropriate use of automated contamination identification tools.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a member of the APP family of proteins, and different enzymatic processing leads to the production of several derivatives that are shown to have distinct biological functions. APP is involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder causing dementia. Furthermore, it is believed that individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have increased APP expression, due to an extra copy of chromosome 21 (Hsa21), that contains the gene for APP. Nevertheless, the physiological function of APP remains unclear. It is known that APP plays an important role in neural growth and maturation during brain development, possibly by influencing proliferation, cell fate specification and neurogenesis of neural stem cells (NSCs). Proteolytic cleavage of APP occurs mainly via two mutually exclusive pathways, the non-amyloidogenic pathway or the amyloidogenic pathway. Other alternative pathways ($\eta$-secretase, $\delta$-secretase and meprin pathways) have also been described for the physiological processing of APP. The different metabolites generated from these pathways, including soluble APP$\alpha$ (sAPP$\alpha$), soluble APP$\beta$ (sAPP$\beta$), $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) peptides and the APP intracellular domain (AICD), have different functions determined by their structural differences, equilibrium and concentration with respect to other fragments derived from APP. This review discusses recent observations regarding possible functions of APP and its proteolytic derivatives in the biology and phenotypic specification of NSCs. This can be important for a better understanding of the pathogenesis and the development of future therapeutic applications for AD and/or DS, diseases in which alterations in neurogenesis have been described.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been widely studied due to its association with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the physiological functions of APP are still largely unexplored. APP is a transmembrane glycoprotein whose expression in humans is abundant in the central nervous system. Specifically, several studies have revealed the high expression of APP during brain development. Previous studies in our laboratory revealed that a transient increase in APP expression induces early cell cycle exit of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and directs their differentiation towards glial cells (gliogenesis) while decreasing their differentiation towards neurons (neurogenesis). In the present study, we have evaluated the intrinsic cellular effects of APP down-expression (using siRNA) on cell death, cell proliferation, and cell fate specification of hNSCs. Our data indicate that APP silencing causes cellular effects opposite to those obtained in previous APP overexpression assays, inducing cell proliferation in hNS1 cells (a model line of hNSCs) and favoring neurogenesis instead of gliogenesis in these cells. In addition, we have analyzed the gene and protein expression levels of upbeta-Catenin as a possible molecule involved in these cellular effects. These data could help to understand the biological role of APP, which is necessary to deepen the knowledge of AD.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Neurogenesis in the developing human cerebral cortex occurs at a particularly slow rate owing in part to cortical neural progenitors preserving their progenitor state for a relatively long time, while generating neurons. How this balance between the progenitor and neurogenic state is regulated, and whether it contributes to species-specific brain temporal patterning, is poorly understood. Here, we show that the characteristic potential of human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to remain in a progenitor state as they generate neurons for a prolonged amount of time requires the amyloid precursor protein (APP). In contrast, APP is dispensable in mouse NPCs, which undergo neurogenesis at a much faster rate. Mechanistically, APP cell-autonomously contributes to protracted neurogenesis through suppression of the proneurogenic activator protein-1 transcription factor and facilitation of canonical WNT signaling. We propose that the fine balance between self-renewal and differentiation is homeostatically regulated by APP, which may contribute to human-specific temporal patterns of neurogenesis.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The physiological actions of orally ingested peptides on the brain remain poorly understood. This study examined the effects of 39 orally administered synthetic Tyr-containing dipeptides on the enhancement of brain norepinephrine metabolism in mice by comparing the concentration of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG). Although Tyr-Tyr administration increased blood and cerebral cortex (Cx) Tyr concentrations the most, Tyr-Trp increased Cx MHPG concentration the most. The oral administration of Tyr-Trp ameliorated a short-term memory deficit of a mouse model of cognitive dysfunction induced by amyloid beta peptide 25-35. Gene expression profiling of mouse brain using a microarray indicated that Tyr-Trp administration led to a wide variety of changes in mRNA levels, including the upregulation of genes encoding molecules involved in catecholamine metabolism. A comparative metabolome analysis of the Cx of mice given Tyr-Trp or Tyr-Tyr demonstrated that Tyr-Trp administration yielded higher concentrations of Trp and kynurenine pathway metabolites than Tyr-Tyr administration, as well as higher L-dopa levels, which is the initial product of catecholamine metabolism. Catecholamines were not significantly increased in the Cx of the Tyr-Tyr group compared with the Tyr-Trp group, despite a marked increase in Tyr. Presumably, Tyr-Trp administration enhances catecholamine synthesis and metabolism via the upregulation of genes involved in Tyr and Trp metabolism as well as metabolites of Tyr and Trp. These findings strongly suggest that orally ingested Tyr-Trp modulates the brain metabolome involved in catecholamine metabolism and contributes to higher brain function.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Besides its role in coagulation, vitamin K seems to be involved in various other mechanisms, including inflammation and age-related diseases, also at the level of gene expression. This work examined the roles of two vitamin K2 (menaquinones) vitamers, namely, menaquinone-4 (MK4) and reduced menaquinone-7 (MK7R), as gene modulator compounds, as well as their potential role in the epigenetic regulation of genes involved in amyloidogenesis and neuroinflammation. The SK-N-BE human neuroblastoma cells provided a Ux201c[bad char  vv=8220]first-lineUx201d[bad char  vv=8221] model for screening the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative molecular pathways. MK7R, being a new vitamin K form, was first tested in terms of solubilization, uptake and cell viability, together with MK4 as an endogenous control. We assessed the expression of key factors in amyloidogenesis and neuroinflammation, observing that the MK7R treatment was associated with the downregulation of neurodegeneration- (PSEN1 and BACE1) and neuroinflammation- (IL-1upbeta and IL-6) associated genes, whereas genes retaining protective roles toward amiloidogenesis were upregulated (ADAM10 and ADAM17). By profiling the DNA methylation patterns of genes known to be epigenetically regulated, we observed a correlation between hypermethylation and the downregulation of PSEN1, IL-1upbeta and IL-6. These results suggest a possible role of MK7R in the treatment of cognitive impairment, giving a possible base for further preclinical experiments in animal models of neurodegenerative disease.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title> <jats:p>In mammals, copper (Cu) absorption occurs mostly in the small intestine, and some of the Cu transporters involved in its uptake have been characterised. In fish, however, the regions of the gut involved in Cu absorption and the membrane transport mechanisms responsible for gastrointestinal Cu uptake are unknown. Everted gut sacs and isolated perfused intestine of Clarias gariepinus were used to explore Cu absorption (at 22 \textdegreeC). Gut sacs exposed to 100 upmumol lminus1mucosal solution Cu ([Cu]m) showed that Cu was mostly (70 %) absorbed in the middle and hind intestine. Most of the accumulated Cu was located in the mucosa. In perfused intestines, cumulative Cu absorption from the mucosal solution to the serosal perfusate was greatest at 10 upmumol lminus1[Cu]m and decreased at higher values of [Cu]m, while tissue accumulation of Cu showed a dose-dependent elevation. Absorption efficiency therefore declined with increasing Cu dose, and basolateral transport was the limiting factor in Cu uptake. Serosal applications of the P-type ATPase inhibitor vanadate (100 upmumol lminus1) or the anion transport inhibitor DIDS (100 upmumol lminus1) caused threefold increases in net Cu uptake (at [Cu]m=10 upmumol lminus1). The vanadate effect was explained by a reduction in transepithelial potential rather than inhibition of Cu-ATPase, but the DIDS effect was not. Transepithelial potential, water transport and tissue [Cu] were not affected by DIDS, but tissue [K+] was elevated. Removal of Clminussimultaneously from both the mucosal and serosal solutions caused a 10-fold reduction in the rate of Cu uptake, while removal of Clminusfrom the mucosal solution only completely abolished Cu absorption to the serosal perfusate. Transepithelial potential effects are discussed. We conclude that Cu absorption occurs mostly in the intestine and is normally driven by a basolateral Cu/anion symport that prefers Clminus.</jats:p>},

description = {The article looks at the basic mechanisms of anemia in patients with liver cirrhosis (bleeding through esophageal varices, hemorrhoids, vascular fragility, hypertensive portal gastropathy, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, vitamin K deficiency, splenic rupture, splenic sequestration of red blood cells in splenomegaly) and also the additional mechanisms of anemia in liver cirrhosis (erythropoietin deficiency, renal injury, chronic inflammation, deficiency of trace elements and vitamins, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, Zieve syndrome). Depending on the Child-Pugh staging of liver cirrhosis, as well as the associated pathologies of the patient with liver cirrhosis, it is possible that there are simultaneously several ways of the appearance of anemia. It is an attempt to achieve more than a simple review of them in a tabular form, focusing not only on physiopathology, but also on diagnostic and therapeutic elements - the latter being briefly mentioned in widely known situations and presented in more detail in the context of the rarer causes of anemia in patients with liver cirrhosis. In conclusion, the differential and positive diagnosis of anemia in liver cirrhosis decisively influences the therapeutic decision and, of course, not only survival, but also the patient's quality of life. Interdisciplinary collaboration (family doctor, gastroenterologist, internist, infectious disease specialist, hematologist, surgeon, ICA, medical imaging, laboratory) is the optimal way to a diagnosis and targeted treatment of the causes of anemia in liver cirrhosis.},

abstract = {Copper (Cu) in its ionic forms is an essential element for mammals and its homeostasis is tightly controlled. Accordingly{,} Cu-dyshomeostasis can be lethal as is the case in the well-established genetic Wilson{'}s and Menkes diseases. In Alzheimer{'}s disease (AD){,} Cu-accumulation occurs in amyloid plaques{,} where it is bound to the amyloid-beta peptide (Aupbeta). In vitro{,} Cu-Aupbeta is competent to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of ascorbate under aerobic conditions{,} and hence Cu-Aupbeta is believed to contribute to the oxidative stress in AD. Several molecules that can recover extracellular Cu from Aupbeta and transport it back into cells with beneficial effects in cell culture and transgenic AD models were identified. However{,} all the Cu-shuttles currently available are not satisfactory due to various potential limitations including ion selectivity and toxicity. Hence{,} we designed a novel peptide-based Cu shuttle with the following properties: (i) it contains a Cu(ii)-binding motif that is very selective to Cu(ii) over all other essential metal ions; (ii) it is tagged with a fluorophore sensitive to Cu(ii)-binding and release; (iii) it is made of a peptide platform{,} which is very versatile to add new functions. The work presented here reports on the characterization of AKH-upalphaR5W4NBD{,} which is able to transport Cu ions selectively into PC12 cells and the imported Cu appeared bioavailable{,} likely via reductive release induced by glutathione. Moreover{,} AKH-upalphaR5W4NBD was able to withdraw Cu from the Aupbeta1-16 peptide and consequently inhibited the Cu-Aupbeta based reactive oxygen species production and related cell toxicity. Hence{,} AKH-upalphaR5W4NBD could be a valuable new tool for Cu-transport into cells and suitable for mechanistic studies in cell culture{,} with potential applications in restoring Cu-homeostasis in Cu-related diseases such as AD.},

In Alzheimer{'}s disease (AD){,} Cu-accumulation occurs in amyloid plaques{,} where it is bound to the amyloid-beta peptide (AŒ≤). In vitro{,} CuÄìAŒ≤ is competent to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of ascorbate under aerobic conditions{,} and hence CuÄìAŒ≤ is believed to contribute to the oxidative stress in AD. Several molecules that can recover extracellular Cu from AŒ≤ and transport it back into cells with beneficial effects in cell culture and transgenic AD models were identified. However{,} all the Cu-shuttles currently available are not satisfactory due to various potential limitations including ion selectivity and toxicity. Hence{,} we designed a novel peptide-based Cu shuttle with the following properties: (i) it contains a Cu(ii)-binding motif that is very selective to Cu(ii) over all other essential metal ions; (ii) it is tagged with a fluorophore sensitive to Cu(ii)-binding and release; (iii) it is made of a peptide platform{,} which is very versatile to add new functions. The work presented here reports on the characterization of AKH-ŒR5W4NBD{,} which is able to transport Cu ions selectively into PC12 cells and the imported Cu appeared bioavailable{,} likely via reductive release induced by glutathione. Moreover{,} AKH-ŒR5W4NBD was able to withdraw Cu from the AŒ≤1Äì16 peptide and consequently inhibited the Cu-AŒ≤ based reactive oxygen species production and related cell toxicity. Hence{,} AKH-ŒR5W4NBD could be a valuable new tool for Cu-transport into cells and suitable for mechanistic studies in cell culture{,} with potential applications in restoring Cu-homeostasis in Cu-related diseases such as AD.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>The classical deficiency diseases have nearly disappeared from the industrialised world and are thought to be found largely in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. More than 80 collected medical articles, mostly from Europe and North America, describe more than 9000 people with low concentrations of copper in organs or tissues or impaired metabolic pathways dependent on copper. More than a dozen articles reveal improved anatomy, chemistry or physiology in more than 1000 patients from supplements containing copper. These criteria are diagnostic of deficiency according to The Oxford Textbook of Medicine. Alzheimer's disease, ischaemic heart disease and osteoporosis receive major emphasis here. However, impaired vision, myelodysplastic syndrome and peripheral neuropathy are mentioned. Copper deficiency probably causes some common, contemporaneous diseases. Advice is provided about opportunities for research. Seemingly authoritative statements concerning the rarity of nutritional deficiency in developed countries are wrong.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and its homologues are transmembrane proteins required for various aspects of neuronal development and activity, whose molecular function is unknown. Specifically, it is unclear whether APP acts as a receptor, and if so what its ligand(s) may be. We show that APP binds the Wnt ligands Wnt3a and Wnt5a and that this binding regulates APP protein levels. Wnt3a binding promotes full-length APP (flAPP) recycling and stability. In contrast, Wnt5a promotes APP targeting to lysosomal compartments and reduces flAPP levels. A conserved Cysteine-Rich Domain (CRD) in the extracellular portion of APP is required for Wnt binding, and deletion of the CRD abrogates the effects of Wnts on flAPP levels and trafficking. Finally, loss of APP results in increased axonal and reduced dendritic growth of mouse embryonic primary cortical neurons. This phenotype can be cell-autonomously rescued by full length, but not CRD-deleted, APP and regulated by Wnt ligands in a CRD-dependent manner.},

The results indicated that exposure to 6 mg/l Cu for 72 h induced the production of reactive oxygen species, thereby increasing protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation in enterocytes of grass carp <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>. Cells exposed to Cu alone resulted in a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase release, which is accompanied by depletions of antioxidants, including total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), anti-superoxide anion (ASA), anti-hydroxy radical (AHR) activities and GSH content. Pre-treatment with Glu remarkably prevented the toxic effects of Cu on the T-SOD, GST, GR, AHR, and ASA activities and GSH content in enterocytes. However, Cu induced an adaptive increase in the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Glu supplementation further increased GPx activity in enterocytes. Interestingly, the experiment <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> showed that Glu pre-supplementation significantly elevated SOD, GPx, GST, GR, ASA and AHR activities, as well as GSH content. Further results showed that pre-treatment with Glu could alleviate Cu-induced oxidative injury by elevating antioxidant enzyme activities through regulating the expression of NF-E2-related nuclear factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA. Together, these results indicated that Glu could attenuate Cu-induced cellular oxidative damage in fish intestine, likely mediated through Nrf2 signalling pathways regulating mRNA expressions of antioxidant enzyme genes and synthesis of GSH.</jats:p>},

We herein describe in detail a case series of liver disease patients (n\NBSP=\NBSP12) who presented with signs of copper deficiency based on serum and liver copper measurements. Median age of the group at the time of presentation was 39 (range 1864 years). Six patients were female. The median serum copper was 46 upmug/dL (normal range: 80155 upmug/dL for women and 70140 upmug/dL for men). Seven of the 12 patients had hepatic copper concentration less than 10 upmug/g dry weight (normal range: 1035 upmug/g).

abstract = {<jats:p>Ceruloplasmin is a ferroxidase that plays a role in iron homeostasis; its deficiency fosters inter alia iron accumulation in the liver, which expresses the soluble form of the protein secreted into the bloodstream. Ceruloplasmin is also secreted by the adipose tissue, but its role in adipocytes has been poorly investigated. We hypothesized that ceruloplasmin might have a role in iron/lipid interplay. We investigated iron/lipid dysmetabolism in the liver and adipose tissue of the ceruloplasmin-deficient mouse (CpKO) model of aceruloplasminemia and evaluated the effectiveness of ceruloplasmin replacement. We found that CpKO mice were overweight, showing adipose tissue accumulation, liver iron deposition and steatosis. In the adipose tissue of CpKO mice, iron homeostasis was not altered. Conversely, the levels of adiponectin and leptin adipokines behaved opposite to the wild-type. Increased macrophage infiltration was observed in adipose tissue and liver of CpKO mice, indicating tissue inflammation. The treatment of CpKO mice with ceruloplasmin limited liver iron accumulation and steatosis without normalizing the expression of iron homeostasis-related proteins. In the CpKO mice, the protein replacement limited macrophage infiltration in both adipose and hepatic tissues reduced the level of serum triglycerides, and partially recovered adipokines levels in the adipose tissue. These results underline the link between iron and lipid dysmetabolism in ceruloplasmin-deficient mice, suggesting that ceruloplasmin in adipose tissue has an anti-inflammatory role rather than a role in iron homeostasis. Furthermore, these data also indicate that ceruloplasmin replacement therapy may be effective at a systemic level.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid; AA) and copper (Cu2+) are well used supplements with many health-promoting actions. However, when they are used in combination, the Fenton reaction occurs, leading to the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. Given that kidney is vulnerable to many toxicants including free radicals, we speculated that the in vivo administration of AA plus Cu2+ may cause oxidative kidney injury. The purpose of this study was to address this possibility. Mice were administered with AA and Cu2+, alone or in combination, via oral gavage once a day for various periods. Changes in the systemic oxidative status, as well renal structure and functions, were examined. The administration of AA plus Cu2+ elevated protein oxidation in serum, intestine, bladder, and kidney, as evidenced by the increased sulfenic acid formation and decreased level of free sulfhydryl groups (-SH). The systemic oxidative stress induced by AA plus Cu2+ was associated with a significant loss of renal function and structure, as indicated by the increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and urinary proteins, as well as glomerular and tubular cell injury. These effects of AA and Cu2+ were only observed when used in combination, and could be entirely prevented by thiol antioxidant NAC. Further analysis using cultured renal tubular epithelial cells revealed that AA plus Cu2+ caused cellular protein oxidation and cell death, which could be abolished by NAC and catalase. Moreover, coincubation of AA and Cu2+ led to H2O2 production. Collectively, our study revealed that a combined administration of AA and Cu2+ resulted in systemic oxidative stress and renal cell injury. As health-promoting supplements, AA and Cu2+ should not be used together.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p> During newborn lung injury, excessive activity of lysyl oxidases (LOXs) disrupts extracellular matrix (ECM) formation. Previous studies indicate that TGFupbeta activation in the O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-injured mouse pup lung increases lysyl oxidase (LOX) expression. But how TGFupbeta regulates this, and whether the LOXs generate excess pulmonary aldehydes are unknown. First, we determined that O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-mediated lung injury increases LOX protein expression in TGFupbeta-stimulated pup lung interstitial fibroblasts. This regulation appeared to be direct; this is because TGFupbeta treatment also increased LOX protein expression in isolated pup lung fibroblasts. Then using a fibroblast cell line, we determined that TGFupbeta stimulates LOX expression at a transcriptional level via Smad2/3-dependent signaling. LOX is translated as a pro-protein that requires secretion and extracellular cleavage before assuming amine oxidase activity and, in some cells, reuptake with nuclear localization. We found that pro-LOX is processed in the newborn mouse pup lung. Also, O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-mediated injury was determined to increase pro-LOX secretion and nuclear LOX immunoreactivity particularly in areas populated with interstitial fibroblasts and exhibiting malformed ECM. Then, using molecular probes, we detected increased aldehyde levels in vivo in O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-injured pup lungs, which mapped to areas of increased pro-LOX secretion in lung sections. Increased activity of LOXs plays a critical role in the aldehyde generation; an inhibitor of LOXs prevented the elevation of aldehydes in the O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-injured pup lung. These results reveal new mechanisms of TGFupbeta and LOX in newborn lung disease and suggest that aldehyde-reactive probes might have utility in sensing the activation of LOXs in vivo during lung injury. </jats:p>},

abstract = {{This study determined taste thresholds for copper as its speciation was varied among free cupric ion, complexed cupric ion, and precipitated cupric particles. The impact of copper chemistry on taste is important as copper is added to many beverages and can be present in drinking water as a natural mineral or due to corrosion of copper plumbing. A one-of-five test was used to define thresholds with solutions containing 0.025-8 mg/l Cu (from copper sulfate) in distilled or mineralized water of varying pH. The mineralized water was designed to mimic the composition of a typical tap water. Group thresholds for copper in either distilled-deionized water or mineralized water were not significantly different and ranged from 0.4 to 0.8 mg/l Cu. A difference from control test was used to assess the impact of soluble and particulate copper on taste. Soluble copper species, including free cupric ion and complexed copper species, were readily tasted, while particulate copper was poorly tasted.}},

abstract = {<jats:p>Biologically active metals such as copper, zinc and iron are fundamental for sustaining life in different organisms with the regulation of cellular metal homeostasis tightly controlled through proteins that coordinate metal uptake, efflux and detoxification. Many of the proteins involved in either uptake or efflux of metals are localised and function on the plasma membrane, traffic between intracellular compartments depending upon the cellular metal environment and can undergo recycling via the endosomal pathway. The biogenesis of exosomes also occurs within the endosomal system, with several major neurodegenerative disease proteins shown to be released in association with these vesicles, including the amyloidupbeta (Aupbeta) peptide in Alzheimer's disease and the infectious prion protein involved in Prion diseases. Aupbeta peptide and the prion protein also bind biologically active metals and are postulated to play important roles in metal homeostasis. In this review, we will discuss the role of extracellular vesicles in Alzheimer's and Prion diseases and explore their potential contribution to metal homeostasis.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Cuproptosis is a recently recognized modality of cell death driven by intracellular copper-dependent mitochondrial stress. However, the mediators of the sterile inflammatory response to cuproptotic death are undetermined. Here, we report that high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a damage-associated molecular pattern, is released by cuproptotic cells to initiate inflammation. Mechanically, copper accumulation-induced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to promote HMGB1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased extracellular release. In contrast, genetic (using RNAi) or pharmacologic (using dorsomorphin) inhibition of AMPK activation limits cuproptosis and HMGB1 release. Functionally, the ability of HMGB1-deficient cuproptotic cells to promote advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor (AGER, also known as RAGE)-dependent inflammatory cytokine production is greatly reduced. Thus, HMGB1 is a key immune mediator of cuproptosis-initiated sterile inflammation.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec> <jats:title>Background</jats:title> <jats:p>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a life-threatening heart disease and a common cause of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and subsequent left or biventricular dilatation. A significant number of cases have a genetic etiology; however, as a complex disease, the exact genetic risk factors are largely unknown, and many patients remain without a molecular diagnosis.</jats:p> </jats:sec><jats:sec> <jats:title>Methods</jats:title> <jats:p>We performed GWAS followed by whole-genome, transcriptome, and immunohistochemical analyses in a spontaneously occurring canine model of DCM. Canine gene discovery was followed up in three human DCM cohorts.</jats:p> </jats:sec><jats:sec> <jats:title>Results</jats:title> <jats:p>Our results revealed two independent additive loci associated with the typical DCM phenotype comprising left ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilatation. We highlight two novel candidate genes, <jats:italic>RNF207</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>PRKAA2</jats:italic>, known for their involvement in cardiac action potentials, energy homeostasis, and morphology. We further illustrate the distinct genetic etiologies underlying the typical DCM phenotype and ventricular premature contractions. Finally, we followed up on the canine discoveries in human DCM patients and discovered candidate variants in our two novel genes.</jats:p> </jats:sec><jats:sec> <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title> <jats:p>Collectively, our study yields insight into the molecular pathophysiology of DCM and provides a large animal model for preclinical studies.</jats:p> </jats:sec>},

abstract = {Copper is an essential trace element for the human body. The epidemiological evidence for the association of dietary intake of copper with the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) is limited. We conducted an evaluation of the cross-sectional data gathered from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys spanning from 2007 to 2018, which comprised a total of 17,948 participants. To discern the distinct characteristics of the participants, we performed a univariate analysis and utilized a 1:2 ratio propensity score matching method to minimize the effects of selection bias. We employed weighted univariate as well as three multivariate logistic regression models both prior to and following matching, with the aim of examining the association between dietary copper intake and PD risk. Finally, we used the restricted cubic spline (RCS) methodology in order to investigate possible non-linear relationships. Furthermore, subgroup analysis was undertaken to elicit further understanding concerning the association between copper intake and PD. A negative correlation resulted between dietary copper intake and PD risk in both univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, prior to and following matching. Our findings demonstrate that there is a nonlinear, dose-dependent relationship between copper intake and PD, according to our RCS analysis. In subgroup analysis, copper intake was identified as an important protective factor for individuals who were non-Hispanic White, unmarried, and had completed higher education. Dietary copper intake was associated with the risk of PD. Supplementation of dietary copper may have potentially beneficial effects.},

abstract = {<jats:p> Histomorphologic, histochemical, and atomic absorption analysis studies were performed on liver tissue from 623 clinically normal purebred and mixed-breed dogs to assess the range of hepatic copper concentrations, the histologic distribution of copper, and the histomorphologic changes associated with the various copper concentrations that were found. Atomic absorption analysis revealed a continuous numerical spectrum ranging from less than 100 parts per million on a dry weight basis (ppm dw) to more than 2,000. No decisive numerical criterion was found that could be used to separate normal from abnormal copper concentrations because of this continuous array. The threshold for histochemical demonstration of copper-containing granules using rhodanine or rubeanic acid staining was 400 ppm dw. At this concentration the copper-containing granules were located in the centrilobular hepatocytes (zone 3 of Rappaport). Copper-containing granules were found in the midzonal and periportal hepatocytes (zones 2 and 1 of Rappaport) in livers with 1,000 ppm dw and higher copper concentrations. The majority of the 623 livers were normal histomorphologically. Multifocal hepatitis characterized by mixed inflammatory cell accumulation and centrilobular distribution was found to be associated with copper concentrations in the range of 2,000 ppm dw or higher. An appropriate upper limit for normal hepatic copper concentration in the dog was not determined based on the present study. </jats:p>},

Whether this also occurs during pregnancy and lactation, when iron supplementation is frequently recommended, is, however, unknown. Here, the hypothesis that high dietary iron will perturb copper homeostasis in pregnant and lactating dams and their pups was tested. We utilized a rat model of iron-deficiency/iron supplementation during pregnancy and lactation to assess this possibility. Rat dams were fed low-iron diets early in pregnancy, and then switched to one of 5 diets with normal (1\texttimes) to high iron (20\texttimes) until pups were 14 days old. Subsequently, copper and iron homeostasis, and intestinal copper absorption (by oral, intragastric gavage with 64Cu), were assessed. Copper depletion/deficiency occurred in the dams and pups as dietary iron increased, as evidenced by decrements in plasma ceruloplasmin (Cp) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) activity, depletion of hepatic copper, and liver iron loading. Intestinal copper transport and tissue 64Cu accumulation were lower in dams consuming excess iron, and tissue 64Cu was also low in suckling pups. In some cases, physiological disturbances were noted when dietary iron was only ~3-fold in excess, while for others, effects were observed when dietary iron was 10-20-fold in excess. Excess enteral iron thus antagonizes the absorption of dietary copper, causing copper depletion in dams and their suckling pups. Low milk copper is a likely explanation for copper depletion in the pups, but experimental proof of this awaits future experimentation.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Copper (Cu) is a vital element required for cellular growth and development; however, even slight changes in its homeostasis might lead to severe toxicity and deleterious medical conditions. Cancer patients are typically associated with higher Cu content in serum and tumor tissues, indicating increased demand of cancer cells for this micronutrient. Cu is known to readily cycle between the +1 and +2 oxidation state in biological systems. The mechanism of action of Cu complexes is typically based on their redox activity and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to deadly oxidative stress. However, there are a number of other biomolecular mechanisms beyond ROS generation that contribute to the activity of anticancer Cu drug candidates. In this review, we discuss how interfering with intracellular Cu balance via either diet modification or addition of inorganic Cu supplements or Cu-modulating compounds affects tumor development, progression, and sensitivity to treatment modalities. We aim to provide the rationale for the use of Cu-depleting and Cu-overloading conditions to generate the best possible patient outcome with minimal toxicity. We also discuss the advantages of the use of pre-formed Cu complexes, such as Cu-(bis)thiosemicarbazones or Cu-N-heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones, in comparison with the in situ formed Cu complexes with metal-binding ligands. In this review, we summarize available clinical and mechanistic data on clinically relevant anticancer drug candidates, including Cu supplements, Cu chelators, Cu ionophores, and Cu complexes.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Senile plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer disease (AD) are primarily composed of the amyloidupbeta (Aupbeta) peptide and contain substantially elevated levels of iron, copper and zinc. These metals bind to Aupbeta and have been reported to increase the toxicity of Aupbeta to cultured neurones. Other reports have demonstrated that Aupbeta can reduce the neurotoxicity of metal ions, suggesting that the interaction can, under some circumstances, be protective. To investigate these apparently conflicting results, human Aupbetai42 was coinjected with iron, copper or zinc (at the concentrations found in plaques) into rat cerebral cortex, and the resulting numbers of dying neurones were compared. It was found that Aupbeta complexed with either iron or zinc was more toxic than Aupbeta alone. In contrast, Aupbetacopper complexes were not neurotoxic. Surprisingly, we observed that when iron or copper were combined with Aupbeta, the neurotoxicity of these metals was substantially reduced, suggesting that Aupbeta may help to limit the toxicity of redoxactive metal ions, thereby assisting the antioxidant defence of the brain. Thus paradoxical effects occur when AP complexes with metal ions, where Aupbetametal complexes are capable of being neurotoxic and neuroprotective.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are prevalent and currently incurable conditions that progressively impair cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric functions of the central or peripheral nervous system. Fibrinogen, a macromolecular glycoprotein, plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response and tissue repair in the human body and interacts with various nervous system cells due to its unique molecular structure. Accumulating evidence suggests that fibrinogen deposits in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. By regulating pathophysiological mechanisms and signaling pathways, fibrinogen can exacerbate the neuro-pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases, while depletion of fibrinogen contributes to the amelioration of cognitive function impairment in patients. This review comprehensively summarizes the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of fibrinogen in central nervous system cells and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Vascular dementia, Huntington's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Additionally, we discuss the potential of fibrinogen-related treatments in the management of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A recent study by Rackaityte et al. reported evidence for a low level of bacterial colonization, specifically of <jats:italic>Micrococcus luteus</jats:italic>, in the intestine of second trimester human fetuses. We have re-analyzed their sequence data and identified a batch effect which violates the underlying assumptions of the bioinformatic method used for contamination removal. This batch effect resulted in <jats:italic>Micrococcus</jats:italic> not being identified as a contaminant in the original work and being falsely assigned to the fetal samples. We further provide evidence that the micrographs presented by Rackaityte et al. are unlikely to show Micrococci or other bacteria as the size of the particles shown exceeds that of related bacterial cells. Finally, phylogenetic analysis showed that the microbes cultured from the fetal samples differed significantly from those detected by sequencing. Overall, our findings show that the presence of <jats:italic>Micrococcus</jats:italic> in the fetal gut is not supported by the primary sequence data. Our findings underline important aspects of the nature of contamination for both sequencing and culture approaches in microbiome studies and the appropriate use of automated contamination identification tools.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a member of the APP family of proteins, and different enzymatic processing leads to the production of several derivatives that are shown to have distinct biological functions. APP is involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder causing dementia. Furthermore, it is believed that individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have increased APP expression, due to an extra copy of chromosome 21 (Hsa21), that contains the gene for APP. Nevertheless, the physiological function of APP remains unclear. It is known that APP plays an important role in neural growth and maturation during brain development, possibly by influencing proliferation, cell fate specification and neurogenesis of neural stem cells (NSCs). Proteolytic cleavage of APP occurs mainly via two mutually exclusive pathways, the non-amyloidogenic pathway or the amyloidogenic pathway. Other alternative pathways ($\eta$-secretase, $\delta$-secretase and meprin pathways) have also been described for the physiological processing of APP. The different metabolites generated from these pathways, including soluble APP$\alpha$ (sAPP$\alpha$), soluble APP$\beta$ (sAPP$\beta$), $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) peptides and the APP intracellular domain (AICD), have different functions determined by their structural differences, equilibrium and concentration with respect to other fragments derived from APP. This review discusses recent observations regarding possible functions of APP and its proteolytic derivatives in the biology and phenotypic specification of NSCs. This can be important for a better understanding of the pathogenesis and the development of future therapeutic applications for AD and/or DS, diseases in which alterations in neurogenesis have been described.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been widely studied due to its association with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the physiological functions of APP are still largely unexplored. APP is a transmembrane glycoprotein whose expression in humans is abundant in the central nervous system. Specifically, several studies have revealed the high expression of APP during brain development. Previous studies in our laboratory revealed that a transient increase in APP expression induces early cell cycle exit of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and directs their differentiation towards glial cells (gliogenesis) while decreasing their differentiation towards neurons (neurogenesis). In the present study, we have evaluated the intrinsic cellular effects of APP down-expression (using siRNA) on cell death, cell proliferation, and cell fate specification of hNSCs. Our data indicate that APP silencing causes cellular effects opposite to those obtained in previous APP overexpression assays, inducing cell proliferation in hNS1 cells (a model line of hNSCs) and favoring neurogenesis instead of gliogenesis in these cells. In addition, we have analyzed the gene and protein expression levels of upbeta-Catenin as a possible molecule involved in these cellular effects. These data could help to understand the biological role of APP, which is necessary to deepen the knowledge of AD.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Neurogenesis in the developing human cerebral cortex occurs at a particularly slow rate owing in part to cortical neural progenitors preserving their progenitor state for a relatively long time, while generating neurons. How this balance between the progenitor and neurogenic state is regulated, and whether it contributes to species-specific brain temporal patterning, is poorly understood. Here, we show that the characteristic potential of human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to remain in a progenitor state as they generate neurons for a prolonged amount of time requires the amyloid precursor protein (APP). In contrast, APP is dispensable in mouse NPCs, which undergo neurogenesis at a much faster rate. Mechanistically, APP cell-autonomously contributes to protracted neurogenesis through suppression of the proneurogenic activator protein-1 transcription factor and facilitation of canonical WNT signaling. We propose that the fine balance between self-renewal and differentiation is homeostatically regulated by APP, which may contribute to human-specific temporal patterns of neurogenesis.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The physiological actions of orally ingested peptides on the brain remain poorly understood. This study examined the effects of 39 orally administered synthetic Tyr-containing dipeptides on the enhancement of brain norepinephrine metabolism in mice by comparing the concentration of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG). Although Tyr-Tyr administration increased blood and cerebral cortex (Cx) Tyr concentrations the most, Tyr-Trp increased Cx MHPG concentration the most. The oral administration of Tyr-Trp ameliorated a short-term memory deficit of a mouse model of cognitive dysfunction induced by amyloid beta peptide 25-35. Gene expression profiling of mouse brain using a microarray indicated that Tyr-Trp administration led to a wide variety of changes in mRNA levels, including the upregulation of genes encoding molecules involved in catecholamine metabolism. A comparative metabolome analysis of the Cx of mice given Tyr-Trp or Tyr-Tyr demonstrated that Tyr-Trp administration yielded higher concentrations of Trp and kynurenine pathway metabolites than Tyr-Tyr administration, as well as higher L-dopa levels, which is the initial product of catecholamine metabolism. Catecholamines were not significantly increased in the Cx of the Tyr-Tyr group compared with the Tyr-Trp group, despite a marked increase in Tyr. Presumably, Tyr-Trp administration enhances catecholamine synthesis and metabolism via the upregulation of genes involved in Tyr and Trp metabolism as well as metabolites of Tyr and Trp. These findings strongly suggest that orally ingested Tyr-Trp modulates the brain metabolome involved in catecholamine metabolism and contributes to higher brain function.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Besides its role in coagulation, vitamin K seems to be involved in various other mechanisms, including inflammation and age-related diseases, also at the level of gene expression. This work examined the roles of two vitamin K2 (menaquinones) vitamers, namely, menaquinone-4 (MK4) and reduced menaquinone-7 (MK7R), as gene modulator compounds, as well as their potential role in the epigenetic regulation of genes involved in amyloidogenesis and neuroinflammation. The SK-N-BE human neuroblastoma cells provided a Ux201c[bad char  vv=8220]first-lineUx201d[bad char  vv=8221] model for screening the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative molecular pathways. MK7R, being a new vitamin K form, was first tested in terms of solubilization, uptake and cell viability, together with MK4 as an endogenous control. We assessed the expression of key factors in amyloidogenesis and neuroinflammation, observing that the MK7R treatment was associated with the downregulation of neurodegeneration- (PSEN1 and BACE1) and neuroinflammation- (IL-1upbeta and IL-6) associated genes, whereas genes retaining protective roles toward amiloidogenesis were upregulated (ADAM10 and ADAM17). By profiling the DNA methylation patterns of genes known to be epigenetically regulated, we observed a correlation between hypermethylation and the downregulation of PSEN1, IL-1upbeta and IL-6. These results suggest a possible role of MK7R in the treatment of cognitive impairment, giving a possible base for further preclinical experiments in animal models of neurodegenerative disease.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title> <jats:p>In mammals, copper (Cu) absorption occurs mostly in the small intestine, and some of the Cu transporters involved in its uptake have been characterised. In fish, however, the regions of the gut involved in Cu absorption and the membrane transport mechanisms responsible for gastrointestinal Cu uptake are unknown. Everted gut sacs and isolated perfused intestine of Clarias gariepinus were used to explore Cu absorption (at 22 \textdegreeC). Gut sacs exposed to 100 upmumol lminus1mucosal solution Cu ([Cu]m) showed that Cu was mostly (70 %) absorbed in the middle and hind intestine. Most of the accumulated Cu was located in the mucosa. In perfused intestines, cumulative Cu absorption from the mucosal solution to the serosal perfusate was greatest at 10 upmumol lminus1[Cu]m and decreased at higher values of [Cu]m, while tissue accumulation of Cu showed a dose-dependent elevation. Absorption efficiency therefore declined with increasing Cu dose, and basolateral transport was the limiting factor in Cu uptake. Serosal applications of the P-type ATPase inhibitor vanadate (100 upmumol lminus1) or the anion transport inhibitor DIDS (100 upmumol lminus1) caused threefold increases in net Cu uptake (at [Cu]m=10 upmumol lminus1). The vanadate effect was explained by a reduction in transepithelial potential rather than inhibition of Cu-ATPase, but the DIDS effect was not. Transepithelial potential, water transport and tissue [Cu] were not affected by DIDS, but tissue [K+] was elevated. Removal of Clminussimultaneously from both the mucosal and serosal solutions caused a 10-fold reduction in the rate of Cu uptake, while removal of Clminusfrom the mucosal solution only completely abolished Cu absorption to the serosal perfusate. Transepithelial potential effects are discussed. We conclude that Cu absorption occurs mostly in the intestine and is normally driven by a basolateral Cu/anion symport that prefers Clminus.</jats:p>},

description = {The article looks at the basic mechanisms of anemia in patients with liver cirrhosis (bleeding through esophageal varices, hemorrhoids, vascular fragility, hypertensive portal gastropathy, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, vitamin K deficiency, splenic rupture, splenic sequestration of red blood cells in splenomegaly) and also the additional mechanisms of anemia in liver cirrhosis (erythropoietin deficiency, renal injury, chronic inflammation, deficiency of trace elements and vitamins, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, Zieve syndrome). Depending on the Child-Pugh staging of liver cirrhosis, as well as the associated pathologies of the patient with liver cirrhosis, it is possible that there are simultaneously several ways of the appearance of anemia. It is an attempt to achieve more than a simple review of them in a tabular form, focusing not only on physiopathology, but also on diagnostic and therapeutic elements - the latter being briefly mentioned in widely known situations and presented in more detail in the context of the rarer causes of anemia in patients with liver cirrhosis. In conclusion, the differential and positive diagnosis of anemia in liver cirrhosis decisively influences the therapeutic decision and, of course, not only survival, but also the patient's quality of life. Interdisciplinary collaboration (family doctor, gastroenterologist, internist, infectious disease specialist, hematologist, surgeon, ICA, medical imaging, laboratory) is the optimal way to a diagnosis and targeted treatment of the causes of anemia in liver cirrhosis.},

abstract = {Copper (Cu) in its ionic forms is an essential element for mammals and its homeostasis is tightly controlled. Accordingly{,} Cu-dyshomeostasis can be lethal as is the case in the well-established genetic Wilson{'}s and Menkes diseases. In Alzheimer{'}s disease (AD){,} Cu-accumulation occurs in amyloid plaques{,} where it is bound to the amyloid-beta peptide (Aupbeta). In vitro{,} Cu-Aupbeta is competent to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of ascorbate under aerobic conditions{,} and hence Cu-Aupbeta is believed to contribute to the oxidative stress in AD. Several molecules that can recover extracellular Cu from Aupbeta and transport it back into cells with beneficial effects in cell culture and transgenic AD models were identified. However{,} all the Cu-shuttles currently available are not satisfactory due to various potential limitations including ion selectivity and toxicity. Hence{,} we designed a novel peptide-based Cu shuttle with the following properties: (i) it contains a Cu(ii)-binding motif that is very selective to Cu(ii) over all other essential metal ions; (ii) it is tagged with a fluorophore sensitive to Cu(ii)-binding and release; (iii) it is made of a peptide platform{,} which is very versatile to add new functions. The work presented here reports on the characterization of AKH-upalphaR5W4NBD{,} which is able to transport Cu ions selectively into PC12 cells and the imported Cu appeared bioavailable{,} likely via reductive release induced by glutathione. Moreover{,} AKH-upalphaR5W4NBD was able to withdraw Cu from the Aupbeta1-16 peptide and consequently inhibited the Cu-Aupbeta based reactive oxygen species production and related cell toxicity. Hence{,} AKH-upalphaR5W4NBD could be a valuable new tool for Cu-transport into cells and suitable for mechanistic studies in cell culture{,} with potential applications in restoring Cu-homeostasis in Cu-related diseases such as AD.},

In Alzheimer{'}s disease (AD){,} Cu-accumulation occurs in amyloid plaques{,} where it is bound to the amyloid-beta peptide (AŒ≤). In vitro{,} CuÄìAŒ≤ is competent to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of ascorbate under aerobic conditions{,} and hence CuÄìAŒ≤ is believed to contribute to the oxidative stress in AD. Several molecules that can recover extracellular Cu from AŒ≤ and transport it back into cells with beneficial effects in cell culture and transgenic AD models were identified. However{,} all the Cu-shuttles currently available are not satisfactory due to various potential limitations including ion selectivity and toxicity. Hence{,} we designed a novel peptide-based Cu shuttle with the following properties: (i) it contains a Cu(ii)-binding motif that is very selective to Cu(ii) over all other essential metal ions; (ii) it is tagged with a fluorophore sensitive to Cu(ii)-binding and release; (iii) it is made of a peptide platform{,} which is very versatile to add new functions. The work presented here reports on the characterization of AKH-ŒR5W4NBD{,} which is able to transport Cu ions selectively into PC12 cells and the imported Cu appeared bioavailable{,} likely via reductive release induced by glutathione. Moreover{,} AKH-ŒR5W4NBD was able to withdraw Cu from the AŒ≤1Äì16 peptide and consequently inhibited the Cu-AŒ≤ based reactive oxygen species production and related cell toxicity. Hence{,} AKH-ŒR5W4NBD could be a valuable new tool for Cu-transport into cells and suitable for mechanistic studies in cell culture{,} with potential applications in restoring Cu-homeostasis in Cu-related diseases such as AD.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>The classical deficiency diseases have nearly disappeared from the industrialised world and are thought to be found largely in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. More than 80 collected medical articles, mostly from Europe and North America, describe more than 9000 people with low concentrations of copper in organs or tissues or impaired metabolic pathways dependent on copper. More than a dozen articles reveal improved anatomy, chemistry or physiology in more than 1000 patients from supplements containing copper. These criteria are diagnostic of deficiency according to The Oxford Textbook of Medicine. Alzheimer's disease, ischaemic heart disease and osteoporosis receive major emphasis here. However, impaired vision, myelodysplastic syndrome and peripheral neuropathy are mentioned. Copper deficiency probably causes some common, contemporaneous diseases. Advice is provided about opportunities for research. Seemingly authoritative statements concerning the rarity of nutritional deficiency in developed countries are wrong.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and its homologues are transmembrane proteins required for various aspects of neuronal development and activity, whose molecular function is unknown. Specifically, it is unclear whether APP acts as a receptor, and if so what its ligand(s) may be. We show that APP binds the Wnt ligands Wnt3a and Wnt5a and that this binding regulates APP protein levels. Wnt3a binding promotes full-length APP (flAPP) recycling and stability. In contrast, Wnt5a promotes APP targeting to lysosomal compartments and reduces flAPP levels. A conserved Cysteine-Rich Domain (CRD) in the extracellular portion of APP is required for Wnt binding, and deletion of the CRD abrogates the effects of Wnts on flAPP levels and trafficking. Finally, loss of APP results in increased axonal and reduced dendritic growth of mouse embryonic primary cortical neurons. This phenotype can be cell-autonomously rescued by full length, but not CRD-deleted, APP and regulated by Wnt ligands in a CRD-dependent manner.},

The results indicated that exposure to 6 mg/l Cu for 72 h induced the production of reactive oxygen species, thereby increasing protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation in enterocytes of grass carp <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>. Cells exposed to Cu alone resulted in a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase release, which is accompanied by depletions of antioxidants, including total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), anti-superoxide anion (ASA), anti-hydroxy radical (AHR) activities and GSH content. Pre-treatment with Glu remarkably prevented the toxic effects of Cu on the T-SOD, GST, GR, AHR, and ASA activities and GSH content in enterocytes. However, Cu induced an adaptive increase in the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Glu supplementation further increased GPx activity in enterocytes. Interestingly, the experiment <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> showed that Glu pre-supplementation significantly elevated SOD, GPx, GST, GR, ASA and AHR activities, as well as GSH content. Further results showed that pre-treatment with Glu could alleviate Cu-induced oxidative injury by elevating antioxidant enzyme activities through regulating the expression of NF-E2-related nuclear factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA. Together, these results indicated that Glu could attenuate Cu-induced cellular oxidative damage in fish intestine, likely mediated through Nrf2 signalling pathways regulating mRNA expressions of antioxidant enzyme genes and synthesis of GSH.</jats:p>},

We herein describe in detail a case series of liver disease patients (n\NBSP=\NBSP12) who presented with signs of copper deficiency based on serum and liver copper measurements. Median age of the group at the time of presentation was 39 (range 1864 years). Six patients were female. The median serum copper was 46 upmug/dL (normal range: 80155 upmug/dL for women and 70140 upmug/dL for men). Seven of the 12 patients had hepatic copper concentration less than 10 upmug/g dry weight (normal range: 1035 upmug/g).

abstract = {<jats:p>Ceruloplasmin is a ferroxidase that plays a role in iron homeostasis; its deficiency fosters inter alia iron accumulation in the liver, which expresses the soluble form of the protein secreted into the bloodstream. Ceruloplasmin is also secreted by the adipose tissue, but its role in adipocytes has been poorly investigated. We hypothesized that ceruloplasmin might have a role in iron/lipid interplay. We investigated iron/lipid dysmetabolism in the liver and adipose tissue of the ceruloplasmin-deficient mouse (CpKO) model of aceruloplasminemia and evaluated the effectiveness of ceruloplasmin replacement. We found that CpKO mice were overweight, showing adipose tissue accumulation, liver iron deposition and steatosis. In the adipose tissue of CpKO mice, iron homeostasis was not altered. Conversely, the levels of adiponectin and leptin adipokines behaved opposite to the wild-type. Increased macrophage infiltration was observed in adipose tissue and liver of CpKO mice, indicating tissue inflammation. The treatment of CpKO mice with ceruloplasmin limited liver iron accumulation and steatosis without normalizing the expression of iron homeostasis-related proteins. In the CpKO mice, the protein replacement limited macrophage infiltration in both adipose and hepatic tissues reduced the level of serum triglycerides, and partially recovered adipokines levels in the adipose tissue. These results underline the link between iron and lipid dysmetabolism in ceruloplasmin-deficient mice, suggesting that ceruloplasmin in adipose tissue has an anti-inflammatory role rather than a role in iron homeostasis. Furthermore, these data also indicate that ceruloplasmin replacement therapy may be effective at a systemic level.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid; AA) and copper (Cu2+) are well used supplements with many health-promoting actions. However, when they are used in combination, the Fenton reaction occurs, leading to the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. Given that kidney is vulnerable to many toxicants including free radicals, we speculated that the in vivo administration of AA plus Cu2+ may cause oxidative kidney injury. The purpose of this study was to address this possibility. Mice were administered with AA and Cu2+, alone or in combination, via oral gavage once a day for various periods. Changes in the systemic oxidative status, as well renal structure and functions, were examined. The administration of AA plus Cu2+ elevated protein oxidation in serum, intestine, bladder, and kidney, as evidenced by the increased sulfenic acid formation and decreased level of free sulfhydryl groups (-SH). The systemic oxidative stress induced by AA plus Cu2+ was associated with a significant loss of renal function and structure, as indicated by the increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and urinary proteins, as well as glomerular and tubular cell injury. These effects of AA and Cu2+ were only observed when used in combination, and could be entirely prevented by thiol antioxidant NAC. Further analysis using cultured renal tubular epithelial cells revealed that AA plus Cu2+ caused cellular protein oxidation and cell death, which could be abolished by NAC and catalase. Moreover, coincubation of AA and Cu2+ led to H2O2 production. Collectively, our study revealed that a combined administration of AA and Cu2+ resulted in systemic oxidative stress and renal cell injury. As health-promoting supplements, AA and Cu2+ should not be used together.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p> During newborn lung injury, excessive activity of lysyl oxidases (LOXs) disrupts extracellular matrix (ECM) formation. Previous studies indicate that TGFupbeta activation in the O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-injured mouse pup lung increases lysyl oxidase (LOX) expression. But how TGFupbeta regulates this, and whether the LOXs generate excess pulmonary aldehydes are unknown. First, we determined that O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-mediated lung injury increases LOX protein expression in TGFupbeta-stimulated pup lung interstitial fibroblasts. This regulation appeared to be direct; this is because TGFupbeta treatment also increased LOX protein expression in isolated pup lung fibroblasts. Then using a fibroblast cell line, we determined that TGFupbeta stimulates LOX expression at a transcriptional level via Smad2/3-dependent signaling. LOX is translated as a pro-protein that requires secretion and extracellular cleavage before assuming amine oxidase activity and, in some cells, reuptake with nuclear localization. We found that pro-LOX is processed in the newborn mouse pup lung. Also, O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-mediated injury was determined to increase pro-LOX secretion and nuclear LOX immunoreactivity particularly in areas populated with interstitial fibroblasts and exhibiting malformed ECM. Then, using molecular probes, we detected increased aldehyde levels in vivo in O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-injured pup lungs, which mapped to areas of increased pro-LOX secretion in lung sections. Increased activity of LOXs plays a critical role in the aldehyde generation; an inhibitor of LOXs prevented the elevation of aldehydes in the O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-injured pup lung. These results reveal new mechanisms of TGFupbeta and LOX in newborn lung disease and suggest that aldehyde-reactive probes might have utility in sensing the activation of LOXs in vivo during lung injury. </jats:p>},

abstract = {{This study determined taste thresholds for copper as its speciation was varied among free cupric ion, complexed cupric ion, and precipitated cupric particles. The impact of copper chemistry on taste is important as copper is added to many beverages and can be present in drinking water as a natural mineral or due to corrosion of copper plumbing. A one-of-five test was used to define thresholds with solutions containing 0.025-8 mg/l Cu (from copper sulfate) in distilled or mineralized water of varying pH. The mineralized water was designed to mimic the composition of a typical tap water. Group thresholds for copper in either distilled-deionized water or mineralized water were not significantly different and ranged from 0.4 to 0.8 mg/l Cu. A difference from control test was used to assess the impact of soluble and particulate copper on taste. Soluble copper species, including free cupric ion and complexed copper species, were readily tasted, while particulate copper was poorly tasted.}},

abstract = {<jats:p>Biologically active metals such as copper, zinc and iron are fundamental for sustaining life in different organisms with the regulation of cellular metal homeostasis tightly controlled through proteins that coordinate metal uptake, efflux and detoxification. Many of the proteins involved in either uptake or efflux of metals are localised and function on the plasma membrane, traffic between intracellular compartments depending upon the cellular metal environment and can undergo recycling via the endosomal pathway. The biogenesis of exosomes also occurs within the endosomal system, with several major neurodegenerative disease proteins shown to be released in association with these vesicles, including the amyloidupbeta (Aupbeta) peptide in Alzheimer's disease and the infectious prion protein involved in Prion diseases. Aupbeta peptide and the prion protein also bind biologically active metals and are postulated to play important roles in metal homeostasis. In this review, we will discuss the role of extracellular vesicles in Alzheimer's and Prion diseases and explore their potential contribution to metal homeostasis.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Cuproptosis is a recently recognized modality of cell death driven by intracellular copper-dependent mitochondrial stress. However, the mediators of the sterile inflammatory response to cuproptotic death are undetermined. Here, we report that high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a damage-associated molecular pattern, is released by cuproptotic cells to initiate inflammation. Mechanically, copper accumulation-induced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to promote HMGB1 phosphorylation, resulting in increased extracellular release. In contrast, genetic (using RNAi) or pharmacologic (using dorsomorphin) inhibition of AMPK activation limits cuproptosis and HMGB1 release. Functionally, the ability of HMGB1-deficient cuproptotic cells to promote advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor (AGER, also known as RAGE)-dependent inflammatory cytokine production is greatly reduced. Thus, HMGB1 is a key immune mediator of cuproptosis-initiated sterile inflammation.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec> <jats:title>Background</jats:title> <jats:p>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a life-threatening heart disease and a common cause of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and subsequent left or biventricular dilatation. A significant number of cases have a genetic etiology; however, as a complex disease, the exact genetic risk factors are largely unknown, and many patients remain without a molecular diagnosis.</jats:p> </jats:sec><jats:sec> <jats:title>Methods</jats:title> <jats:p>We performed GWAS followed by whole-genome, transcriptome, and immunohistochemical analyses in a spontaneously occurring canine model of DCM. Canine gene discovery was followed up in three human DCM cohorts.</jats:p> </jats:sec><jats:sec> <jats:title>Results</jats:title> <jats:p>Our results revealed two independent additive loci associated with the typical DCM phenotype comprising left ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilatation. We highlight two novel candidate genes, <jats:italic>RNF207</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>PRKAA2</jats:italic>, known for their involvement in cardiac action potentials, energy homeostasis, and morphology. We further illustrate the distinct genetic etiologies underlying the typical DCM phenotype and ventricular premature contractions. Finally, we followed up on the canine discoveries in human DCM patients and discovered candidate variants in our two novel genes.</jats:p> </jats:sec><jats:sec> <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title> <jats:p>Collectively, our study yields insight into the molecular pathophysiology of DCM and provides a large animal model for preclinical studies.</jats:p> </jats:sec>},

abstract = {Copper is an essential trace element for the human body. The epidemiological evidence for the association of dietary intake of copper with the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) is limited. We conducted an evaluation of the cross-sectional data gathered from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys spanning from 2007 to 2018, which comprised a total of 17,948 participants. To discern the distinct characteristics of the participants, we performed a univariate analysis and utilized a 1:2 ratio propensity score matching method to minimize the effects of selection bias. We employed weighted univariate as well as three multivariate logistic regression models both prior to and following matching, with the aim of examining the association between dietary copper intake and PD risk. Finally, we used the restricted cubic spline (RCS) methodology in order to investigate possible non-linear relationships. Furthermore, subgroup analysis was undertaken to elicit further understanding concerning the association between copper intake and PD. A negative correlation resulted between dietary copper intake and PD risk in both univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, prior to and following matching. Our findings demonstrate that there is a nonlinear, dose-dependent relationship between copper intake and PD, according to our RCS analysis. In subgroup analysis, copper intake was identified as an important protective factor for individuals who were non-Hispanic White, unmarried, and had completed higher education. Dietary copper intake was associated with the risk of PD. Supplementation of dietary copper may have potentially beneficial effects.},

abstract = {<jats:p> Histomorphologic, histochemical, and atomic absorption analysis studies were performed on liver tissue from 623 clinically normal purebred and mixed-breed dogs to assess the range of hepatic copper concentrations, the histologic distribution of copper, and the histomorphologic changes associated with the various copper concentrations that were found. Atomic absorption analysis revealed a continuous numerical spectrum ranging from less than 100 parts per million on a dry weight basis (ppm dw) to more than 2,000. No decisive numerical criterion was found that could be used to separate normal from abnormal copper concentrations because of this continuous array. The threshold for histochemical demonstration of copper-containing granules using rhodanine or rubeanic acid staining was 400 ppm dw. At this concentration the copper-containing granules were located in the centrilobular hepatocytes (zone 3 of Rappaport). Copper-containing granules were found in the midzonal and periportal hepatocytes (zones 2 and 1 of Rappaport) in livers with 1,000 ppm dw and higher copper concentrations. The majority of the 623 livers were normal histomorphologically. Multifocal hepatitis characterized by mixed inflammatory cell accumulation and centrilobular distribution was found to be associated with copper concentrations in the range of 2,000 ppm dw or higher. An appropriate upper limit for normal hepatic copper concentration in the dog was not determined based on the present study. </jats:p>},

Whether this also occurs during pregnancy and lactation, when iron supplementation is frequently recommended, is, however, unknown. Here, the hypothesis that high dietary iron will perturb copper homeostasis in pregnant and lactating dams and their pups was tested. We utilized a rat model of iron-deficiency/iron supplementation during pregnancy and lactation to assess this possibility. Rat dams were fed low-iron diets early in pregnancy, and then switched to one of 5 diets with normal (1\texttimes) to high iron (20\texttimes) until pups were 14 days old. Subsequently, copper and iron homeostasis, and intestinal copper absorption (by oral, intragastric gavage with 64Cu), were assessed. Copper depletion/deficiency occurred in the dams and pups as dietary iron increased, as evidenced by decrements in plasma ceruloplasmin (Cp) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) activity, depletion of hepatic copper, and liver iron loading. Intestinal copper transport and tissue 64Cu accumulation were lower in dams consuming excess iron, and tissue 64Cu was also low in suckling pups. In some cases, physiological disturbances were noted when dietary iron was only ~3-fold in excess, while for others, effects were observed when dietary iron was 10-20-fold in excess. Excess enteral iron thus antagonizes the absorption of dietary copper, causing copper depletion in dams and their suckling pups. Low milk copper is a likely explanation for copper depletion in the pups, but experimental proof of this awaits future experimentation.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Copper (Cu) is a vital element required for cellular growth and development; however, even slight changes in its homeostasis might lead to severe toxicity and deleterious medical conditions. Cancer patients are typically associated with higher Cu content in serum and tumor tissues, indicating increased demand of cancer cells for this micronutrient. Cu is known to readily cycle between the +1 and +2 oxidation state in biological systems. The mechanism of action of Cu complexes is typically based on their redox activity and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to deadly oxidative stress. However, there are a number of other biomolecular mechanisms beyond ROS generation that contribute to the activity of anticancer Cu drug candidates. In this review, we discuss how interfering with intracellular Cu balance via either diet modification or addition of inorganic Cu supplements or Cu-modulating compounds affects tumor development, progression, and sensitivity to treatment modalities. We aim to provide the rationale for the use of Cu-depleting and Cu-overloading conditions to generate the best possible patient outcome with minimal toxicity. We also discuss the advantages of the use of pre-formed Cu complexes, such as Cu-(bis)thiosemicarbazones or Cu-N-heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones, in comparison with the in situ formed Cu complexes with metal-binding ligands. In this review, we summarize available clinical and mechanistic data on clinically relevant anticancer drug candidates, including Cu supplements, Cu chelators, Cu ionophores, and Cu complexes.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p> The trace metal copper (Cu) plays an essential role in biology as a cofactor for many enzymes that include Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase, cytochrome oxidase, ceruloplasmin, lysyl oxidase, and dopamine upbeta-hydroxylase. Consequently, Cu transport at the cell surface and the delivery of Cu to intracellular compartments are critical events for a wide variety of biological processes. The components that orchestrate intracellular Cu trafficking and their roles in Cu homeostasis have been elucidated by the studies of model microorganisms and by the characterizations of molecular basis of Cu-related genetic diseases, including Menkes disease and Wilson disease. However, little is known about the mechanisms for Cu uptake at the plasma membrane and the consequences of defects in this process in mammals. Here, we show that the mouse <jats:italic>Ctr1</jats:italic> gene encodes a component of the Cu transport machinery and that mice heterozygous for <jats:italic>Ctr1</jats:italic> exhibit tissue-specific defects in copper accumulation and in the activities of copper-dependent enzymes. Mice completely deficient for <jats:italic>Ctr1</jats:italic> exhibit profound growth and developmental defects and die <jats:italic>in utero</jats:italic> in mid-gestation. These results demonstrate a crucial role for Cu acquisition through the Ctr1 transporter for mammalian Cu homeostasis and embryonic development. </jats:p>},

Another disorder causing symptoms similar to copper metabolism disorder is Niemann-Pick type C.

The patient was found to carry 2 mutations in the NPC1 gene. A possible link, explaining how copper deficiency might induce the Niemann-Pick phenotype might involve overproduction of cholesterol and inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase. We suggest that copper metabolism disorders be included in the differential diagnosis for ataxia and dysarthria, even in cases with unusual presentations. Moreover, should the connection between copper and Niemann-Pick be validated, screening for copper metabolism disorders may be advisable in Niemann-Pick type C patients and vice-versa. </jats:p>},

abstract = {<sec>BackgroundCopper (Cu) is essential for the functioning of various enzymes involved in important cellular and physiological processes. Although critical for normal cardiac function, excessive accumulation, or deficiency of Cu in the myocardium is detrimental to the heart. Fluctuations in cardiac Cu content have been shown to cause cardiac pathologies and imbalance in systemic Cu metabolism. However, the genetic basis underlying cardiac Cu levels and their effects on heart traits remain to be understood. Representing the largest murine genetic reference population, BXD strains have been widely used to explore genotype-phenotype associations and identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes.</sec><sec>MethodsCardiac Cu concentration and heart function in BXD strains were measured, followed by QTL mapping. The candidate genes modulating Cu homeostasis in mice hearts were identified using a multi-criteria scoring/filtering approach.</sec><sec>ResultsSignificant correlations were identified between cardiac Cu concentration and left ventricular (LV) internal diameter and volumes at end-diastole and end-systole, demonstrating that the BXDs with higher cardiac Cu levels have larger LV chamber. Conversely, cardiac Cu levels negatively correlated with LV posterior wall thickness, suggesting that lower Cu concentration in the heart is associated with LV hypertrophy. Genetic mapping identified six QTLs containing a total of 217 genes, which were further narrowed down to 21 genes that showed a significant association with cardiac Cu content in mice. Among those, Prex1 and Irx3 are the strongest candidates involved in cardiac Cu modulation.</sec><sec>ConclusionCardiac Cu level is significantly correlated with heart chamber size and hypertrophy phenotypes in BXD mice, while being regulated by multiple genes in several QTLs. Prex1 and Irx3 may be involved in modulating Cu metabolism and its downstream effects and warrant further experimental and functional validations.</sec>},

abstract = {<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title> <jats:p> In bacteria, the intracellular levels of metals are mediated by tightly controlled acquisition and efflux systems. This is particularly true of copper, a trace element that is universally toxic in excess. During infection, the toxic properties of copper are exploited by the mammalian host to facilitate bacterial clearance. To better understand the role of copper during infection, we characterized the contribution of the <jats:italic>cop</jats:italic> operon to copper homeostasis and virulence in <jats:named-content content-type=genus-species>Streptococcus pneumoniae</jats:named-content> . Deletion of either the exporter, encoded by <jats:italic>copA</jats:italic> , or the chaperone, encoded by <jats:italic>cupA</jats:italic> , led to hypersensitivity to copper stress. We further demonstrated that loss of the copper exporter encoded by <jats:italic>copA</jats:italic> led to decreased virulence in pulmonary, intraperitoneal, and intravenous models of infection. Deletion of <jats:italic>copA</jats:italic> resulted in enhanced macrophage-mediated bacterial clearance <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> . The attenuation phenotype of the <jats:italic>copA</jats:italic> mutant in the lung was found to be dependent on pulmonary macrophages, underscoring the importance of copper efflux in evading immune defenses. Overall, these data provide insight into the role of the <jats:italic>cop</jats:italic> operon in pneumococcal pathogenesis. </jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient but excess Cu is potentially toxic. Its important propensity to cycle between two oxidation states accounts for its frequent presence as a cofactor in many physiological processes through Cu-containing enzymes, including mitochondrial energy production (via cytochrome c-oxidase), protection against oxidative stress (via superoxide dismutase), and extracellular matrix stability (via lysyl oxidase). Since free Cu is potentially toxic, the bioavailability of intracellular Cu is tightly controlled by Cu transporters and Cu chaperones. Recent evidence reveals that these Cu transport systems play an essential role in the physiological responses of cardiovascular cells, including cell growth, migration, angiogenesis and wound repair. In response to growth factors, cytokines, and hypoxia, their expression, subcellular localization, and function are tightly regulated. Cu transport systems and their regulators have also been linked to various cardiovascular pathophysiologies such as hypertension, inflammation, atherosclerosis, diabetes, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiomyopathy. A greater appreciation of the central importance of Cu transporters and Cu chaperones in cell signaling and gene expression in cardiovascular biology offers the possibility of identifying new therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>The Dahl salt-sensitive rat was used to investigate the effect of hypertension on indexes of copper status and to determine the extent to which dietary manipulation of copper attenuated, or exacerbated, the rate of sodium chloride-induced hypertension. Weanling salt-sensitive rats were fed, in a 2 x 3 factorial design, one of six diets that contained one of three levels of copper (2.0 micrograms/g marginal, 12 micrograms/g adequate, or 50 micrograms/g supplemental) and either control (0.4%) or high (4%) levels of sodium. Diets were fed to the rats for 11 weeks. Rats fed the high sodium diets were characterized by high plasma copper concentrations and ceruloplasmin activities compared with their respective control sodium rats. The magnitude of the sodium-induced rise in plasma copper and ceruloplasmin was affected by dietary copper intake; however, dietary copper intake had no effect on the development of hypertension in the high sodium groups. These results suggest that altered copper metabolism is secondary, rather than primary, to the development of sodium chloride-induced hypertension in the salt-sensitive rat. Red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity was reduced in rats fed the low copper diets compared with the adequate and supplemented copper groups. At the lower levels of copper intake, sodium chloride-induced hypertension increased red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity in a manner consistent with the plasma copper and ceruloplasmin changes observed. However, at adequate or supplemental levels of dietary copper, red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity plateaued, suggesting possible saturation of copper at sites of hematopoeisis.</jats:p>},

abstract = {{Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element for all aerobic organisms. It functions as a cofactor in enzymes that catalyze a wide variety of redox reactions due to its ability to cycle between two oxidation states, Cu(i) and Cu(ii). This same redox property of copper has the potential to cause toxicity if copper homeostasis is not maintained. Studies suggest that the toxic properties of copper are harnessed by the innate immune system of the host to kill bacteria. To counter such defenses, bacteria rely on copper tolerance genes for virulence within the host. These discoveries suggest bacterial copper intoxication is a component of host nutritional immunity, thus expanding our knowledge of the roles of copper in biology. This review summarizes our current understanding of copper tolerance in bacteria, and the extent to which these pathways contribute to bacterial virulence within the host.}},

Changes in carbohydrate metabolism are accompanied by oxidative stress, which may disturb the mineral balance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of Tau supplementation on the levels of trace elements in rats fed either a standard (AIN-93M, 4{\%} fat) diet or a modified high-fat diet (30{\%} fat). For 8\NBSPweeks, male Wistar rats were fed these diets supplemented with 3{\%} Tau. Taurine supplementation normalized increased serum insulin concentration and insulin resistance index; however, it did not improve serum CRP concentration in high-fat diet fed rats. The high-fat diet supplemented with Tau decreased the renal and splenic Zn levels, but the tissular Fe content did not change. The effect of Tau supplementation on the mineral balance to some extent depended on the fat content in the rats' diet. The high-fat diet supplemented with Tau decreased the rats' splenic Zn levels but increased their femur levels. In the group fed the standard diet, Tau reduced the rats' femur Zn level, whereas their splenic Zn level was comparable. Tau supplementation decreased the renal Cu level and serum ceruloplasmin concentration in the rats fed the standard diet, but this effect was not observed in the rats fed the high-fat diet. In conclusion, supplementary taurine failed to ameliorate disturbances in mineral homeostasis caused by high-fat diet feeding and led to tissular redistribution of Zn and Cu in the rat.},

The homeostasis of gut microbiota impacts on the structural and functional integrity of gut epithelial barrier. Microbiota also serve as signalling sources to inform the host of the metabolism and functional changes. Microbiota dysbiosis negatively affect human health, contributing to diseases like obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, and asthma. Not by coincidence, these pathological conditions are also closely related to the abnormal metabolism and function of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S signalling.H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S serves as a bacterial signal to the host and the host-produced H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S impacts on the population and size of microbiota. These bi-directional interactions become especially important for the digestion and utilization of sulfur amino acid in diet. Dietary restriction of sulfur amino acid increases the endogenous production of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S by the host and consequently offers many health benefits. It, on the other hand, decreases the nutritional supply to the microbiota, which could be remedied by the co-application of prebiotics and probiotics. It is strategically sound to target the expression of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S-producing enzymes in different organs to slow aging processes in our body and promote better health.</jats:p>},

abstract = {{The lysosomal system operates as a focal point where a number of important physiological processes such as endocytosis, autophagy and nutrient sensing converge. One of the key functions of lysosomes consists of regulating the metabolism/homeostasis of metals. Metal-containing components are carried to the lysosome through incoming membrane flows, while numerous transporters allow metal ions to move across the lysosome membrane. These properties enable lysosomes to direct metal fluxes to the sites where metal ions are either used by cellular components or sequestered. Copper belongs to a group of metals that are essential for the activity of vitally important enzymes, although it is toxic when in excess. Thus, copper uptake, supply and intracellular compartmentalization have to be tightly regulated. An increasing number of publications have indicated that these processes involve lysosomes. Here we review studies that reveal the expanding role of the lysosomal system as a hub for the control of Cu homeostasis and for the regulation of key Cu-dependent processes in health and disease.}},

Clinical signs are usually proportional to the degree of collapse, ranging from mild airway irritation and paroxysmal coughing to respiratory distress and dyspnoea. Diagnosis is made by documenting dynamic airway collapse with radiographs, bronchoscopy or fluoroscopy. Most dogs respond well to medical management and treatment of any concurrent comorbidities. Surgical intervention may need to be considered in dogs that do not respond or have respiratory compromise.

abstract = {{Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been in the literature and news because of the recent opinion-based journal articles and public releases by regulatory agencies. DCM is commonly associated with a genetic predisposition in certain dog breeds and can also occur secondary to other diseases and nutritional deficiencies. Recent communications in veterinary journals have discussed a potential relationship between grain-free and/or novel protein diets to DCM, citing a subjective increase in DCM in dog breeds that are not known to have a genetic predisposition for the disease. This literature review describes clinical presentations of DCM, common sequelae, treatment and preventative measures, histopathologic features, and a discussion of the varied etiological origins of the disease. In addition, current literature limitations are addressed, in order to ascertain multiple variables leading to the development of DCM. Future studies are needed to evaluate one variable at a time and to minimize confounding variables and speculation. Furthermore, to prevent sampling bias with the current FDA reports, the veterinary community should be asked to provide information for all cases of DCM in dogs. This should include cases during the same time period, regardless of the practitioner's proposed etiology, due to no definitive association between diets with specific characteristics, such as, but not limited to, grain-free diets and those containing legumes, novel protein diets, and those produced by small manufacturers to DCM in dogs. In summary, in order to determine if certain ingredients, categories of diets, or manufacturing processes are related to an increased risk of DCM, further studies investigating these variables are necessary.}},

abstract = {Wilson{\textquoteright}s disease (WD) is a copper metabolic disorder, which is caused by defective ATP7B function. Here, we have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from WD patients carrying compound heterozygous mutations on ATP7B. ATP7B loss- and gain-of-functions were further manifested with ATP7B-deficient iPSCs and heterozygously-corrected R778L WD patient-derived iPSCs using CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing. Transcriptome analysis identified abnormalities of retinoid signaling pathway and lipid metabolism in WD-specific hepatocytes. Although the expression level of ATP7B protein was variable among WD-specific hepatocytes, the expression and secretion of ceruloplasmin (Cp), which is a downstream copper carrier in plasma, were consistently decreased. Cp secretion-based drug screening identified all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as promising candidates for rescuing Cp secretion. ATRA also alleviated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by lipid accumulation in WD-specific hepatocytes. Our patient-derived iPSC-based hepatic models provide potential therapeutics for liver steatosis in WD and other fatty liver diseases.},

Liver copper increased in control and iron-deficient rats fed extra copper. Hepatic Cp mRNA levels did not change; however, serum Cp protein was higher during iron deprivation and with higher copper consumption. In-gel and spectrophotometric ferroxidase and amine oxidase assays demonstrated that Cp activity was enhanced when hepatic copper loading occurred. Interestingly, liver copper levels strongly correlated with Cp protein expression and activity. These observations support the possibility that liver copper loading increases metallation of the Cp protein, leading to increased production of the holo enzyme.

abstract = {Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is uniquely adapted to colonize the gastric mucosa. The key components for gastric colonization include motility, adhesion, and acid acclimation. The flagellar system allows the bacteria to move within the gastric mucus layer to the sites where conditions are optimal for survival. Adhesion to the gastric mucosa, via interaction between bacterial and host proteins, allows the bacteria to withstand the bulk flow of gastric fluid. Acid acclimation is the system that allows for periplasmic and cytoplasmic pH regulation in the setting of an acidic environment. The bacteria are bioenergetically neutralophiles, meaning they are able to survive between pH 4 and 8 and grow between pH 6 and 8. The pH at the gastric surface in the presence of H. pylori, as shown by microelectrode, fluorescent dye, and in vivo transcriptome studies, is below the range for growth and near to below the limits for survival. The bacteria are able to sense acidic medium pH and stimulate the trafficking of cytoplasmic urease and its accessory proteins to the proton-gated urea channel, UreI, in the inner membrane. The breakdown of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia buffers the periplasm and cytoplasm to within the pH range optimal for a neutralophile. Understanding gastric colonization is clinically relevant because these systems that facilitate colonization can be targeted or interfered with to improve the efficacy of eradication regimens.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Significance</jats:title><jats:p>Zinc deficiency in the human population, a major public health concern, can also be a consequence of nutritional deficiency in protein uptake. The discovery that tryptophan metabolites 3-hydroxykynurenine and xanthurenic acid are major zinc-binding ligands in insect cells establishes the kynurenine pathway as a regulator of systemic zinc homeostasis. Many biological processes influenced by zinc and the kynurenine pathway, including the regulation of innate and acquired immune responses to viral infections, have not been studied in light of the direct molecular links revealed in this study.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The current contribution reviews absorption and metabolism of copper (Cu), Cu deficiency, Cu toxicity, Cu bioavailability, and effects of pharmacological levels of Cu on growth performance and intestinal health of pigs. Copper is a micro mineral involved in metabolic reactions including cellular respiration, tissue pigmentation, hemoglobin formation, and connective tissue development. Copper is mostly absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the duodenum, but some Cu is absorbed in the stomach. One way to evaluate the efficacy of sources of Cu is to measure relative bioavailability where responses include tissue concentrations of Cu, concentrations of metalloproteins, and enzymatic activity of animals fed test diets containing graded levels of Cu. The requirement for Cu by pigs is 5 to 10mg/kg diet, however, Cu can be included at growth-promoting levels (i.e., 75 to 250mg/kg diet) in diets for weanling and growing pigs to reduce post-weaning diarrhea and improve growth performance. The consistently observed improvement in growth performance upon Cu supplementation is likely a result of increases in lipase activity, growth hormone secretion, and expression of genes involved in post-absorptive metabolism of lipids. The growth-promoting effects of dietary Cu have also been attributed to its bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties because Cu may change bacterial populations in the intestine, and thereby reduce inflammation caused by pathogens. However, further research is needed to determine potential interactions between Cu and non-nutritive feed additives (e.g., enzymes, probiotics, phytobiotics), and the optimum quantity of Cu as well as the optimum duration of feeding supplemental Cu in diets for pigs should be further investigated. These gaps needs to be addressed to maximize inclusion of Cu in diets to improve growth performance while minimizing diseases and mortality.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tryptophan is an essential amino acid with a huge functional versatility, in addition to its participation in protein synthesis. Because of the complexity of its metabolism, and the functional relevance of several of its metabolites, it directly or indirectly participates in a wide array of physiological pathways. This amino acid is a precursor for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter/neuromodulator serotonin (5<jats:styled-content style=fixed-case>HT</jats:styled-content>), the hormone melatonin and kynurenine and related compounds such as kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid or niacin. Because of this, it has a key role in the regulation of processes ranging from the neuroendocrine to the immune system in vertebrates. In aquaculture, extensive research has been performed to optimize the levels of tryptophan in the commercial diets for many fish species. Providing adequate levels of this amino acid is critically important for fish growth but also for fish welfare, as tryptophan has been shown to modulate fish behaviour, stress responses, and antioxidant and immune systems. Currently, available data suggest a wide variation in tryptophan requirements of different species ranging 0.3-1.3% of dietary protein level, but recent evidence also shows that fish tryptophan requirements can greatly vary depending on the rearing conditions of the fish. We also review here the participation of tryptophan and related metabolites in different physiological functions that are crucial for fish welfare. The review covers the involvement of tryptophan in 5<jats:styled-content style=fixed-case>HT</jats:styled-content> and melatoninmediated functions, along with its participation in the regulation of the immune system and its role as an antioxidant and antitoxic agent in fish.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) enzyme activity is usually measured as a part of liver function test (LFT) to detect increases in its activity. Less attention has been put to know the conditions associated with decreases in its activity. Micronutrients like Zinc (Zn) and Magnesium (Mg) are important causes of low ALP activity. Our Objective is to find out Zn and Mg deficiencies as important cause of decrease in ALP activity and to initiate supplementation of these minerals. The study was done to assess Zn and Mg deficiency in 42 persons having low ALP activity and 45 healthy controls. Correlation between minerals and ALP activities were also carried out. It was found that 52.38% of cases are Mg deficient and 47.62% cases are Zn deficient. A significant decrease in Zn and Mg was observed in low ALP cases when compared with control (p\&lt;0.001, p\&lt;0.05). Significant positive correlation was found between the minerals and ALP. Serum Zn and Mg are essential for human body and by screening their deficiency, supplementation of minerals can be initiated.</jats:p>},

abstract = {To clarify the changes of mineral levels in different tissues of riboflavin-deficient rats, Wistar rats were separated into three groups. One group was fed a diet ad libitum that was deficient in riboflavin. The other two were fed either the complete diet that was weight-matched to the riboflavin-deficient group or fed a complete diet ad libitum. In riboflavin-deficient rats, the hemoglobin concentration and riboflavin contents of blood, liver, and kidney were significantly decreased, compared with weight-matched and ad libitum-fed controls. The mineral concentrations of tissues are summarized as follows: The iron (Fe) concentration in the heart, liver, and spleen was decreased in the riboflavin-deficient group compared with the other groups. Calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) concentrations in tibia were decreased in the riboflavin-deficient group compared with the other two groups. Copper (Cu) concentration was increased in the heart and liver when the riboflavin-deficient group was compared with the other groups. Zinc (Zn) concentration was increased in tibia when the riboflavin-deficient group was compared with the other groups.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown Cu(0) as a promising material for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants. However, there is no review addressing the studies performed. This fact may be related to the toxicity of the particles and the copper released in solution that has not motivated researchers, which entails in a reduced number of publications. However, studies point out how to solve the problem of Cu deposition in support materials. In this work, a detailed review of Cu(0) applications was performed. The specific focus was the reaction mechanisms related to adsorption, oxidation, and reduction processes. Initially, the resources that allow the understanding of the reaction mechanism, such as characterization techniques and the experimental conditions for investigation of the species involved in the process, were presented. The studies were evaluated separately, showing the mechanisms involved only with the application of Cu(0) in pure and isolated form and in association with oxidizing or reductive agents, combined with irradiation sources and ultrasonic waves and in the form supported in polymer matrices. It was verified that by the proposed reaction mechanisms, the exclusive participation of Cu(0), being the removal process, explained only by the redox behavior of copper. Therefore, the review showed the need for future research regarding the redox behavior of the contaminants.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Iron is an essential element for almost all organisms on Earth. It is necessary for a number of crucial processes such as hemoglobin and myoglobin transport and storage of oxygen in mammals; electron transfer support in a variety of ironsulfur protein or cytochrome reactions; and activation and catalysis of reactions of a wide range of substrate like alkanes, olefins, and alcohols. Living organisms adopted iron as the main metal to carry out all of these functions due to the rich coordination chemistry of its two main redox states, Fe<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> and Fe<jats:sup>3+</jats:sup>, and because of its abundance in the Earth's crust and oceans. This paper presents an overview of the coordination chemistry of iron that makes it suitable for a large variety of functions within biological systems. Despite iron's chemical advantages, organisms were forced to manage with some drawbacks: Fe<jats:sup>3+</jats:sup> insolubility and the formation of toxic radicals, especially the hydroxyl radical. Iron chemistry within biology is an example of how organisms evolved by creating molecular machinery to overcome these difficulties and perform crucial processes with extraordinary elegance and efficiency. \textrm{\small\textcopyright} 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(6):382-388, 2017</jats:p>},

abstract = {The interactions of iron, ascorbic acid and copper may be of concern to humans. Supplements of iron and ascorbic acid are consumed by nearly 30{\%} and 60{\%} of adults, respectively (1), while copper intakes may be marginal (2). Consumption of 1500 mg ascorbic acid daily for 60 days depressed serum ceruloplasmin and copper in adult men (3). The severity of anemia in copper-deficient rats was increased by 1{\%} ascorbic acid in the diet (4). Ascorbic acid may increase the turnover or decrease the absorption of copper (5). We observed that ascorbic acid also decreases iron absorption in copper-deficient rats (4). It has been reported that supplements of iron lessen the severity of copper deficiency anemia in rats (6). However, high doses of iron do not reverse the anemia of copper deficiency in humans (7,8) and we reported that anemia was more severe in copper-deficient rats fed 226 rather than 54 $\mu$g Fe/g diet (9).},

abstract = {<jats:p>Human is evolved and nourished by food so food has been given the prime importance since Vedic period, but if our food itself is polluted then how the development of health hazards can be prevented or checked. The contamination of food is a major concern especially for developing countries like India. Today, society are very careful about the selection of food but unfortunately attention has not been given about selection of cookware and the impact of these cooking utensils on health. Number of good looking cookware sets are made by very dangerous material and coated by toxic chemicals to. Most commonly used cookware sets are Aluminum, Plastic and Non-stick cookware. During cooking process these cookware sets releases many hazardous substances like Teflon, BPA, Aluminum etc., which contaminates food and ultimately reaches to the body and linked as a causative factor for many diseases like Cancer, Alzheimer's disease etc. According to FDA materials that are used to make utensils should not allow to migrate into food. Though, traditionally Earthen pots, Cast- iron, glass, bamboo and copper, stone cookware sets were in use. Those were added therapeutic value in the cooked food. Thus, attention must be needed to choose the correct utensils for cooking which should be safe and beneficial for health. In Ayurveda during the description of eight dietary principles, importance of Vasana (utensils) is mentioned under the description of Karana (processing techniques of food items). Ayurveda believes that container helps in transformation of qualities of food items. Different kinds of utensils had been shown both positive and negative effect on body. Hence, this article makes an attempt to gathered data and compiled to find the health impacts of newly evolved as well as traditional cookware options in society.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Ten germ-free pigs and 10 conventionally reared pigs were fed one of two nutritionally balanced diets containing either 16 ppm Cu (basal) or 283 ppm Cu (high-Cu) to evaluate the physiological relationships between Cu and microbiological environment. Germ-free pigs tended to have higher ADG and average daily feed intake (ADFI) than conventionally reared pigs. Feeding the high-Cu diet tended to reduce ADG and ADFI in germ-free pigs but it increased ADG and ADFI in conventionally reared pigs. Hemoglobin and hematocrit were higher in germ-free pigs than in conventionally reared pigs (P \&lt; .001), and hematocrit (P \&lt; .01) and erythrocyte count (P \&lt; .06) were reduced by feeding the high-Cu diet. Germ-free pigs had lower total leukocyte count (P \&lt; .01) and the relative percentages of differentiated leukocytes were altered compared with conventionally reared pigs. Feeding the high-Cu diet increased the percentage of band neutrophils and monocytes in germ-free pigs but reduced the percentage of these cells in conventionally reared pigs (P \&lt; .04). Germ-free pigs had higher concentrations of Cu and Zn in liver and plasma (P \&lt; .001) and greater plasma ceruloplasmin oxidase activity (P \&lt; .001) than conventionally reared pigs did. The high-Cu diet increased liver Cu and Zn (P \&lt; .001) and plasma Cu (P \&lt; .001) and reduced liver and plasma Fe (P \&lt; .05). Organ weights (g/kg BW) differed between germ-free and conventionally reared pigs, and feeding the high-Cu diet reduced thymus weights (P \&lt; .002). Intestinal weight and thickness were reduced in germ-free pigs, and feeding the high-Cu diet generally reduced villus height and width and crypt depth in germ-free pigs, whereas it increased these measurements in conventionally reared pigs.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The feeding of diets enriched with ascorbic acid (10 g/kg) to rats has previously been shown to lower plasma and liver copper concentrations. The present studies corroborate this. We hypothesized that ascorbic acid initially reduces copper absorption, this effect being masked later by the stimulatory effect on copper absorption of the impaired copper status. We also hypothesized that the impaired copper status as induced by ascorbic acid feeding is followed by a diminished biliary excretion of copper in an attempt to preserve copper homeostasis. Our hypotheses are supported by the present studies. Ascorbic acid feeding initially reduced apparent copper absorption, and in the course of the experiment this effect tended to turn over into a stimulatory effect. Copper deficiency, as induced by feeding a diet containing 1 mg Cu/kg instead of 5 mg Cu/kg, systematically increased copper absorption. Biliary excretion of copper in rats given ascorbic acid was unaffected initialy but became depressed after prolonged ascorbic acid feeding. A similar time course was seen for fecal endogenous copper excretion that was calculated as the difference between true and apparent copper absorption. Copper deficiency systematically reduced biliary copper excretion and fecal endogenous copper loss.},

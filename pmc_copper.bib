abstract = {The hepatic content of amyloid beta (Abeta) decreases drastically in human and rodent cirrhosis highlighting the importance of understanding the consequences of Abeta deficiency in the liver. This is especially relevant in view of recent advances in anti-Abeta therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, it is shown that partial hepatic loss of Abeta in transgenic AD mice immunized with Abeta antibody 3D6 and its absence in amyloid precursor protein (APP) knockout mice (APP-KO), as well as in human liver spheroids with APP knockdown upregulates classical hallmarks of fibrosis, smooth muscle alpha-actin, and collagen type I. Abeta absence in APP-KO and deficiency in immunized mice lead to strong activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta), alpha secretases, NOTCH pathway, inflammation, decreased permeability of liver sinusoids, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Inversely, increased systemic and intrahepatic levels of Abeta42 in transgenic AD mice and neprilysin inhibitor LBQ657-treated wild-type mice protect the liver against carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4) )-induced injury. Transcriptomic analysis of CCl(4) -treated transgenic AD mouse livers uncovers the regulatory effects of Abeta42 on mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, and its onco-suppressive effects accompanied by reduced synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. Combined, these data reveal Abeta as an indispensable regulator of cell-cell interactions in healthy liver and a powerful protector against liver fibrosis.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically by cognitive decline and pathologically by the accumulation of amyloid--containing senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. A great deal of attention has focused on amyloid- as the major pathogenic mechanisms with the ultimate goal of using amyloid- lowering therapies as an avenue of treatment. Unfortunately, nearly a quarter century later, no tangible progress has been offered, whereas spectacular failure tends to be the most compelling. We have long contended, as has substantial literature, that proteinaceous accumulations are simply downstream and, often, endstage manifestations of disease. Their overall poor correlation with the level of dementia, and their presence in the cognitively intact is evidence that is often ignored as an inconvenient truth. Current research examining amyloid oligomers, therefore, will add copious details to what is, in essence, a reductionist distraction from upstream pleiotrophic processes such as oxidative stress, cell cycle dysfunction, and inflammation. It is now long overdue that the neuroscientists avoid the pitfall of perseverating on proteinopathies and recognize that the continued targeting of end stage lesions in the face of repeated failure, or worse, is a losing proposition.},

abstract = {Age is a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke. However, the influence of aging on coagulation parameters in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) remains unclear. A total of 775 samples were collected from 224 NVAF patients receiving apixaban, edoxaban or rivaroxaban. The samples were categorized into three age groups: (i) </= 64 years, (ii) 65-74 years, and (iii) >/= 75 years (apixaban: N = 48, 108, 119; edoxaban: N = 63, 68, 126; rivaroxaban: N = 115, 90, 38, respectively). Coagulation parameters including fibrinogen (Fbg), factor II, factor V, factor VII, factor X, and D-dimer, were compared between the three age groups for each drug. The slopes in the correlation between drug concentrations and modified diluted prothrombin time (mdPT) were also assessed. Fbg and factor V increased with age, while factor II and factor X decreased. Factor VII and D-dimer showed no significant differences across age categories. The slope in response to drug concentrations was similar between the age groups. In NVAF patients treated with apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, some coagulation parameters exhibited age-related variation. However, the response of mdPT to drug concentration was consistent across age categories.},

abstract = {Fibrinogen is an abundant protein synthesized in the liver, present in human blood plasma at concentrations ranging from 1.5-4 g/L in healthy individuals with a normal half-life of 3-5 days. With fibrin, produced by thrombin-mediated cleavage, fibrinogen plays important roles in many physiological processes. Indeed, the formation of a stable blood clot, containing polymerized and cross-linked fibrin, is crucial to prevent blood loss and drive wound healing upon vascular injury. A balance between clotting, notably the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, and fibrinolysis, the proteolytic degradation of the fibrin mesh, is essential. Disruption of this equilibrium can cause disease in distinct manners. While some pathological conditions are the consequence of altered levels of fibrinogen, others are related to structural properties of the molecule. The source of fibrinogen expression and the localization of fibrin(ogen) protein also have clinical implications. Low levels of fibrinogen expression have been detected in extra-hepatic tissues, including carcinomas, potentially contributing to disease. Fibrin(ogen) deposits at aberrant sites including the central nervous system or kidney, can also be pathological. In this review, we discuss disorders in which fibrinogen and fibrin are implicated, highlighting mechanisms that may contribute to disease.},

abstract = {Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors are commonly divided into prohemorrhagic (FII, FVII, FIX, and FX) and antithrombotic (protein C and protein S). Furthermore, another protein (protein Z) does not seem strictly correlated with blood clotting. As a consequence of this assumption, vitamin K-dependent defects were considered as hemorrhagic or thrombotic disorders. Recent clinical observations, and especially, recent advances in molecular biology investigations, have demonstrated that this was incorrect. In 2009, it was demonstrated that the mutation Arg338Leu in exon 8 of FIX was associated with the appearance of a thrombophilic state and venous thrombosis. The defect was characterized by a 10-fold increased activity in FIX activity, while FIX antigen was only slightly increased (FIX Padua). On the other hand, it was noted on clinical grounds that the thrombosis, mainly venous, was present in about 2% to 3% of patients with FVII deficiency. It was subsequently demonstrated that 2 mutations in FVII, namely, Arg304Gln and Ala294Val, were particularly affected. Both these mutations are type 2 defects, namely, they show low activity but normal or near-normal FVII antigen. More recently, in 2011-2012, it was noted that prothrombin defects due to mutations of Arg596 to Leu, Gln, or Trp in exon 15 cause the appearance of a dysprothrombinemia that shows no bleeding tendency but instead a prothrombotic state with venous thrombosis. On the contrary, no abnormality of protein C or protein S has been shown to be associated with bleeding rather than with thrombosis. These studies have considerably widened the spectrum and significance of blood coagulation studies.},

abstract = {Reduced sulfatide level is found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Here, we demonstrate that amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing regulates sulfatide synthesis and vice versa. Different cell culture models and transgenic mice models devoid of APP processing or in particular the APP intracellular domain (AICD) reveal that AICD decreases Gal3st1/CST expression and subsequently sulfatide synthesis. In return, sulfatide supplementation decreases Abeta generation by reducing beta-secretase (BACE1) and gamma-secretase processing of APP. Increased BACE1 lysosomal degradation leads to reduced BACE1 protein level in endosomes. Reduced gamma-secretase activity is caused by a direct effect on gamma-secretase activity and reduced amounts of gamma-secretase components in lipid rafts. Similar changes were observed by analyzing cells and mice brain samples deficient of arylsulfatase A responsible for sulfatide degradation or knocked down in Gal3st1/CST. In line with these findings, addition of sulfatides to brain homogenates of AD patients resulted in reduced gamma-secretase activity. Human brain APP level shows a significant negative correlation with GAL3ST1/CST expression underlining the in vivo relevance of sulfatide homeostasis in AD.},

abstract = {Our group and others have reported a series of studies showing that heavy burdens of diarrheal diseases in the formative first two years of life in children in urban shantytowns have profound consequences of impaired physical and cognitive development lasting into later childhood and schooling. Based on these previous studies showing that apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is relatively common in favela children, we review recent data suggesting a protective role for the APOE4 allele in the cognitive and physical development of children with heavy burdens of diarrhea in early childhood. Despite being a marker for cognitive decline with Alzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases later in life, APOE4 appears to be important for cognitive development under the stress of heavy diarrhea. The reviewed findings provide a potential explanation for the survival advantage in evolution of the thrifty APOE4 allele and raise questions about its implications for human development under life-style changes and environmental challenges.},

abstract = {Mitotic homologous recombination promotes genome stability through the precise repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other lesions that are encountered during normal cellular metabolism and from exogenous insults. As a result, homologous recombination repair is essential during proliferative stages in development and during somatic cell renewal in adults to protect against cell death and mutagenic outcomes from DNA damage. Mutations in mammalian genes encoding homologous recombination proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2, are associated with developmental abnormalities and tumorigenesis. Recent advances have provided a clearer understanding of the connections between these proteins and of the key steps of homologous recombination and DNA strand exchange.},

abstract = {Lysyl oxidase (LO) is a copper-dependent amine oxidase that plays a critical role in the biogenesis of connective tissue matrices by crosslinking the extracellular matrix proteins, collagen and elastin. Levels of LO increase in many fibrotic diseases, while expression of the enzyme is decreased in certain diseases involving impaired copper metabolism. While the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme is not yet available, many of its physical-chemical properties, its novel carbonyl cofactor, and its catalytic mechanism have been described. Lysyl oxidase is synthesized as a preproprotein, secreted as a 50 kDa, N-glycosylated proenzyme and then proteolytically cleaved to the 32 kDa, catalytically active, mature enzyme. Within the past decade, the gene encoding LO has been cloned, facilitating investigations of the regulation of expression of the enzyme in response to diverse stimuli and in numerous disease states. Transforming growth factor-beta, platelet-derived growth factor, angiotensin II, retinoic acid, fibroblast growth factor, altered serum conditions, and shear stress are among the effectors or conditions that regulate LO expression. New, LO-like genes have also been identified and cloned, suggesting the existence of a multigene family. It has also become increasingly evident that LO may have other important biological functions in addition to its role in the crosslinking of elastin and collagen in the extracellular matrix.},

abstract = {The in vitro oxidation of tryptophan (Trp) by pro-oxidant systems such as iron-ascorbate indicates that Trp is a target for oxygen radicals in vivo. The Trp in albumin and lipoproteins has been reported to be actively oxidized by hydroxyl radical (HO(*)) generating systems such as copper-ascorbate or PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) respectively. The super-physiological concentrations of the oxidants used in these studies prompted us to examine the effect of low copper and ascorbate concentrations on Trp oxidation. Trp (10-5000 mumol/L) was incubated with 1.5 mumol/L copper plus ascorbate (0.113 and 1.13 mmol/L) at 37 degrees C and its oxidation followed by fluorescence and high-performance liquid chromatography. The percentage of Trp oxidized by the ascorbate-copper system was inversely related to its concentration and positively related to the ascorbate concentration. High concentrations of Trp (above 50 mumol/L for 0.113 mmol/L and 500 mumol/L for 1.13 mmol/L ascorbate) are not significantly oxidized in the presence of ascorbate. The large drop in the percentage Trp oxidation at higher concentrations may be due to the chelation of copper by Trp. High concentrations of Trp (over 50 mumol/L) strongly prevented ascorbate oxidation by copper, and therefore inhibited the production of HO(*) needed for Trp oxidation. Protein Trp is less readily oxidized by the ascorbate-copper system than free Trp. Proteins chelate copper much better than Trp, and so inhibit its oxidative activity, at least against ascorbic acid.},

abstract = {One-day-old broiler chicks were adapted to a basal, isolated soyprotein-cornstarch diet containing 20% protein, 0.59% methionine and 3,300 kcal metabolizable energy (ME)/kg. They were then fed experimental diets consisting of three levels (0, 500, 1,000 ppm) of copper added to each of the basal diet plus four levels (0, 0.4, 0.8, or 1.5%) of L-methionine for 1 or 4 weeks. Growth was retarded after 1 week by all levels of supplementary methionine, and by 500 or 1,000 ppm excess copper. The plasma concentrations of free methionine, serine, alpha-aminobutyric acid and cystathionine were increased by excess dietary methionine. Excess copper prevented the increase in plasma methionine. After 4 weeks, the plasma methionine concentration and rate of growth of chicks fed 0.4% excess L-methionine did not differ significantly from basal values. The growth retardation caused by 500 ppm excess copper was alleviated by 0.4% supplemental methionine, and the elevations in plasma methionine and liver and spleen iron concentrations observed in chicks fed 1.5% excess methionine were reduced by 1,000 ppm excess copper. The patterns of the relationship between dietary methionine and liver or spleen iron, in the presence or absence of supplementary copper, were similar to those between dietary and free plasma methionine.},

abstract = {Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is activated by its natural ligand, mediating multiple essential biological processes. Copper (II) ions are bioactive ions and are crucial in the regulation of cell signaling pathway. However, the crosstalk between copper (II) ions and RTK-mediated cellular signaling remains unclear. Herein, we reported the effect of copper (II) ions on the ligand-independent RTK cellular signaling pathway. Our results indicate that both EGFR and MET signaling were activated by copper (II) in the absence of the corresponding ligands, EGF and HGF, respectively. Consequently, copper (II) ions initiate two RTK-mediated downstream signal transductions, including AKT and ERK. Moreover, copper (II) significantly increased proliferation and cellular migration. Our study proposes a novel role of copper in RTK-mediated signaling for growth factor-independent cancer cell proliferation and migration, implying that targeting both the copper (II) and growth factor in tumor microenvironments may be necessary for cancer treatment.},

abstract = {Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a multicopper oxidase with ferroxidase properties being of importance to the mobilisation and export of iron from cells and its ability to bind copper. In ageing humans, Cp deficiency is known to result in aceruloplasminemia, which among other is characterised by neurological symptoms. To obtain novel information about the functions of Cp in the central nervous system (CNS) we compared the brain proteome in forebrains from asymptomatic 4-6-month-old Cp-deficient (B6N(Cg)-Cp(tm1b(KOMP)Wtsi) /J) and wild-type mice. Of more than 5600 quantified proteins, 23 proteins, were regulated, whereas more than 1200 proteins had regulated post-translational modifications (PTMs). The genes of the regulated proteins, glycoproteins and phosphoproteins appeared mostly to be located to neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Cp deficiency especially affected the function of proteins involved in the extension of neuronal projections, synaptic signalling and cellular mRNA processing and affected the expression of proteins involved in neurodegenerative disease and diabetes. Iron concentration and transferrin saturation were reduced in the blood of even younger, 3- to 5-month-old, Cp-deficient mice. Iron act as cofactor in many enzymatic processes and reactions. Changes in iron availability and oxidation as consequence of Cp deficiency could therefore affect the synthesis of proteins and lipids. This proteomic characterisation is to our knowledge the first to document the changes taking place in the CNS-proteome and its phosphorylation and glycosylation state in Cp-deficient mice.},

abstract = {Catalytic quinone cofactors derived from posttranslational modification of amino acid residues within the enzyme polypeptide have roles in a variety of biological processes ranging from metabolism in bacteria to inflammation and connective tissue maturation in humans. In recent years, studies of the biosynthesis of one of these cofactors, tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ), have provided examples of novel chemistry that is required for the generation of these protein-derived cofactors. A novel c-type diheme enzyme, MauG, catalyzes a six-electron oxidation that completes TTQ biosynthesis in a 119-kDa protein substrate. The posttranslational modification reactions proceed via an unprecedented Fe(V) equivalent catalytic intermediate comprised of two hemes; one an Fe(IV)=O and the other a six-coordinate Fe(IV) with axial ligands provided by amino acid residues. This high valent diheme species is an alternative to Compound I, an Fe(IV)=O heme with a porphyrin or amino acid cation radical, which is typically the reactive intermediate of heme-dependent oxygenases and peroxidases.},

abstract = {Background: Collagen cross-linking is mediated by lysyl oxidase (LOX) enzyme in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of mitral valve leaflets. Alterations in collagen content and LOX protein expression in the ECM of degenerative mitral valve may enhance leaflet expansion and disease severity. Methods: Twenty posterior degenerative mitral valve leaflets from patients with severe mitral regurgitation were obtained at surgery. Five normal posterior mitral valve leaflets procured during autopsy served as controls. Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) density was quantified by immunohistochemistry, collagen types I and III by picro-sirius red staining and immunohistochemistry, and proteoglycans by alcian blue staining. Protein expression of LOX and its mediator TGF1 were quantified by immunofluorescence and gene expression by PCR. Results: VICs density was increased, structural type I collagen density was reduced, while reparative type III collagen and proteoglycan densities were increased (p<0.0001) with an increase in spongiosa layer thickness in myxomatous valves. These changes were associated with a reduction in LOX (p<0.0001) and increase in TGF1 protein expression (p<0.0001). However, no significant change was seen in gene expression. Linear regression analysis identified a correlation between type I collagen density and LOX grade (R2=0.855; p<0.0001). Conclusions: Reduced type I collagen density with a simultaneous increase in type III collagen and proteoglycan densities possibly contributes to spongiosa layer expansion resulting in incompetent mitral valve leaflets. Observed changes in type I and III collagen densities in DMVD may be secondary to alterations in LOX protein expression, contributing to disorganization of ECM and disease severity.},

abstract = {Changes in speciation of copper(II) in reactions with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and gallic acid (GA) as a function of pH have been investigated by multifrequency (X- and S-band) EPR spectroscopy in the fluid and frozen states. The EPR spectra show the formation of three distinct mononuclear species with each of the polyphenols, and these are interpreted in terms of one mono- and two bis-complexes. However, di- or polymeric complexes dominate the Cu(II) speciation in the pH range 48, and it is only at alkaline pH values that these mononuclear complexes make appreciable contributions to the metal speciation. Each mononuclear complex displays linewidth anisotropy in fluid solution as a consequence of incomplete averaging of the spin Hamiltonian parameters through molecular motion. Rotational correlation times for the individual complexes have been estimated by analysing the lineshape anisotropy of the fluid solution spectra using parameters determined by simulation of the rigid limit spectra. These show that the molecular masses increase with increasing pH, indicating either coordination of increasing numbers of polyphenol molecules as ligands to the copper or the increasing involvement of polyphenol dimers as ligands in the copper coordination sphere.},

abstract = {Speciation can provide knowledge about absorption, reactivity to binding sites, bioavailability, toxicity, and excretion of elements. In this study, the speciation of copper in different model solutions under the influence of gastrointestinal (GI) pH was studied by ion selective electrode (ISE) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). It was found that the electrode response (mV) against Cu2+ decreased with the increase in pH and dropped to the lowest point at pH 7.5 in all model solutions. When amino acids and organic acids were present, the ratio of filtered copper (0.45m, pH 7.5) was more than 90%. When casein was present, whey protein, pancreatin, and starch were added, and the ratio of filtered copper was 85.60.3, 56.78.8, 38.55.1, and 1.00.3%, respectively. When there is not enough organic ligand, excessive copper will form copper hydroxide precipitation with the increase in pH, but it got the highest electrode response (mV) against Cu2+. From this study, it can be concluded that the speciation of copper in GI tract is strongly influenced by the pH and the composition of food. When there are few ligands coexisting in the GI tract, the concentration of copper ion may be relatively high.},

abstract = {Copper is an essential trace metal element that significantly affects human physiology and pathology by regulating various important biological processes, including mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, iron mobilization, connective tissue crosslinking, antioxidant defense, melanin synthesis, blood clotting, and neuron peptide maturation. Increasing lines of evidence obtained from studies of cell culture, animals, and human genetics have demonstrated that dysregulation of copper metabolism causes heart disease, which is the leading cause of mortality in the US. Defects of copper homeostasis caused by perturbed regulation of copper chaperones or copper transporters or by copper deficiency resulted in various types of heart disease, including cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus cardiomyopathy. This review aims to provide a timely summary of the effects of defective copper homeostasis on heart disease and discuss potential underlying molecular mechanisms.},

abstract = {Background: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a life-threatening heart disease and a common cause of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and subsequent left or biventricular dilatation. A significant number of cases have a genetic etiology; however, as a complex disease, the exact genetic risk factors are largely unknown, and many patients remain without a molecular diagnosis. Methods: We performed GWAS followed by whole-genome, transcriptome, and immunohistochemical analyses in a spontaneously occurring canine model of DCM. Canine gene discovery was followed up in three human DCM cohorts. Results: Our results revealed two independent additive loci associated with the typical DCM phenotype comprising left ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilatation. We highlight two novel candidate genes, RNF207 and PRKAA2, known for their involvement in cardiac action potentials, energy homeostasis, and morphology. We further illustrate the distinct genetic etiologies underlying the typical DCM phenotype and ventricular premature contractions. Finally, we followed up on the canine discoveries in human DCM patients and discovered candidate variants in our two novel genes. Conclusions: Collectively, our study yields insight into the molecular pathophysiology of DCM and provides a large animal model for preclinical studies. Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13073-023-01221-3.},

abstract = {Animals that are copper deficient have cardiac hypertrophy where there is a dramatic increase in mitochondria. Mitochondrial biogenesis is enhanced in this model and there is an upregulation of mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) and nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 (NRF-1 and NRF-2). While the cuproenzyme, cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), is an attractive candidate to explain the connection between cardiac hypertrophy in copper deficiency and subsequent mitochondrial biogenesis, studies have revealed that ATP synthase may be impacted by copper depletion. NRF-1 and NRF-2 can bind to some of the subunits of both CCO and ATP synthase to regulate gene expression. Furthermore, oxidative phosphorylation appears to occur unaltered in the copper-deficient state. Copper-deficient mitochondria appear to be less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of oligomycin compared to controls. Decreases in the delta subunit protein and beta mRNA transcript have been reported for ATP synthase as a function of copper deficiency. The limited data available suggest that copper, either indirectly or directly, alters ATP synthase function.},

abstract = {Background: Hypothyroidism is a commonly diagnosed endocrinopathy in dogs. This study aimed to investigate the frequency and risk factors for diagnosis of hypothyroidism in UK primary-care practice. Dogs diagnosed with hypothyroidism were identified by searching electronic patient records of primary-care practices participating in VetCompass. A cohort study design estimated one-year (2016) period prevalence and incidence risk for hypothyroidism. Multivariable binary logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between demographic risk factors and hypothyroidism. Results: From 905,553 dogs, 2,105 dogswere recorded with diagnosed hypothyroidism in 2016; 359 incident and 1,746 pre-existing, giving an annual prevalence of 0.23% (95% CI 0.220.24) andannual incidence risk of 0.04% (95% CI 0.040.04). Multivariable logistic regression identified 24 predisposed and nine protected breeds. Standard Doberman pinscher (odds ratio [OR]=17.02, 95% CI 12.822.64), Tibetan terrier (11.25, 95% CI 8.2715.32) and boxer (10.44, 95% CI 8.6612.58) breeds showed high predisposition. Pug (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.090.89), Yorkshire terrier (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.240.59), Shih-tzu (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.230.64) and Jack Russell terrier (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.290.54) were the most protected breeds. Overall, being a purebred dog, being insured, having bodyweight above the breed-sex mean, increasing age, being neuteredand rising adult bodyweight also showed increased odds being a dog living with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Conclusions: Several strong breed predispositions for diagnosis of hypothyroidism were identified that can assist with disorder prioritisation in ongoingefforts to improve breed health. Other risk factors were also identified that can assist veterinary surgeons during clinical work-up of suspected cases. Identification of novel evidence for protected breeds provides useful information for research into genetic mechanisms.},

abstract = {Background: Trace metals are essential trace elements for the human body, but insufficient or excessive levels of metal ions can lead to the development of disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between dietary intake of copper and the prevalence of kidney stones in U.S. adult population. Methods: We included data on dietary intake of trace metals from 28,623 adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database between 2007 and 2018. Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) dose-response curves were used to explore the association between trace metals and kidney stones, and 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was performed between the stone formers and non-stone formers to test the validity of the results. Results: Dose-response curves showed a non-linear negative association between dietary copper intake and kidney stones, and an increase in copper intake reduced the risk of kidney stones. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for kidney stones in each quartile of copper intake compared to the lowest quartile were 0.905 (0.8081.011, p = 0.075), 0.880 (0.7850.987, p = 0.028) and 0.853 (0.7560.959, p = 0.009). In addition, similar conclusions were reached after analysis of PSM in the stone formers and non-stone formers groups. Conclusion: Dietary copper intake was negatively and non-linearly correlated with kidney stones, which is worthy of further research and application in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Several clinical observations have suggested that copper (Cu) plays a role in regulating haematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) development. To further study this role we used an ex vivo system. Cord blood-derived CD34+ cells were cultured in liquid medium supplemented with Kit- ligand, FLt3, interleukin 6 (IL-6), thrombopoietin and IL-3. Under these conditions, Cu content, measured by atomic absorption, was 7 ng/10(7) cells. Modulation of intracellular Cu was achieved by supplementing the cultures with the Cu chelator tetraethylenepentamine, which reduced cellular Cu (4 ng/10(7) cells), or ceruloplasmin or Cu sulphate that elevated cellular Cu (18 and 14 ng/10(7) cells respectively). The results indicated that low Cu content delayed differentiation, as measured by the surface antigens CD34, CD14 and CD15, colony-forming unit (CFU) frequency and cell morphology, while high Cu accelerated differentiation compared with Cu unmanipulated cultures. As a result, expansion of total cells, CFU and CD34+ cells in low Cu was extended (12-16 weeks), and in high Cu was shortened (2-4 weeks), compared with control cultures (6-8 weeks). These effects required modulation of intracellular Cu only during the first 1-3 weeks of the culture; the long-term effects persisted thereafter, suggesting that the decision process for either self-renewal or differentiation is taken early during the culture. This novel method of controlling cell proliferation and differentiation by copper and copper chelators might be utilized for ex vivo manipulation of HPC for various clinical applications.},

abstract = {Copper (Cu) is an essential metal required for activity of a number of redox active enzymes that participate in critical cellular pathways such as metabolism and cell signaling. Because it is also a toxic metal, Cu must be tightly controlled by a series of transporters and chaperone proteins that regulate Cu homeostasis. The critical nature of Cu is highlighted by the fact that mutations in Cu homeostasis genes cause pathologic conditions such as Menkes and Wilson diseases. While Cu homeostasis in highly affected tissues like the liver and brain is well understood, no study has probed the role of Cu in development of skeletal muscle, another tissue that often shows pathology in these conditions. Here, we found an increase in whole cell Cu content during differentiation of cultured immortalized or primary myoblasts derived from mouse satellite cells. We demonstrate that Cu is required for both proliferation and differentiation of primary myoblasts. We also show that a key Cu homeostasis gene, Atp7a, undergoes dynamic changes in expression during myogenic differentiation. Alternative polyadenylation and stability of Atp7a mRNA fluctuates with differentiation stage of the myoblasts, indicating post-transcriptional regulation of Atp7a that depends on the differentiation state. This is the first report of a requirement for Cu during myogenic differentiation and provides the basis for understanding the network of Cu transport associated with myogenesis.},

abstract = {AIMS: In high doses zinc may cause copper deficiency, a diagnosis that is often missed resulting in anaemia, neutropenia and irreversible neurological symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess if zinc deficiency is erroneously diagnosed by misinterpretation of plasma zinc concentrations and whether copper deficiency is induced in patients prescribed zinc. METHODS: Casenotes of 70 patients prescribed zinc were scrutinised. Plasma concentrations of zinc, copper, C reactive protein and albumin were recorded from the laboratory database. RESULTS: 62% of patients were prescribed zinc at doses sufficient to cause copper deficiency. In 48% of the patients, plasma zinc concentrations were low as a probable result of hypoalbuminaemia or the systemic inflammatory response rather than deficiency. Awareness of copper deficiency was lacking; it was only documented as a possible side effect in one patient and plasma copper was measured in only two patients prescribed zinc. 9% of patients developed unexplained anaemia and 7% developed neurological symptoms typical of copper deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc deficiency is frequently misdiagnosed on the basis of low plasma zinc concentrations. The potential risk of copper deficiency developing in patients prescribed high doses of zinc is apparently infrequently considered. It is probable that a significant minority of patients prescribed with high doses of zinc develop iatrogenic copper deficiency.},

abstract = {Dietary cholesterol causes atherosclerosis along with a reduction of copper concentrations in the atherosclerosis wall. This study was to determine the relationship between aorta copper concentrations and the severity of atherosclerotic lesions as well as copper homeostasis in multiple organs in cholesterol-fed rabbits. Male New Zealand white rabbits, 10-week-old and averaged 2.0 kg, were fed a diet containing 1% (w/w) cholesterol or the same diet without cholesterol as controls. Twelve weeks after the feeding, aortic atherosclerotic lesions, serum cholesterol, and multiple organ copper concentrations were measured. Compared to controls, rabbits fed cholesterol-supplemented diet displayed higher serum cholesterol levels and developed atherosclerosis. Copper concentrations in the cholesterol-fed rabbits were increased in the serum and kidney but decreased in the atherosclerosis wall and multiple organs, including heart, liver, spleen, and lung. Furthermore, aorta copper concentrations negatively correlated, respectively, with the severity of the atherosclerotic lesion (r = - 0.64, p = 0.01), the microscope atherosclerotic lesion area (r = - 0.60, p = 0.02), and the stenosis of the lumen (r = - 0.54, p = 0.04). Dietary cholesterol not only causes atherosclerosis but also disturbs copper homeostasis in multiple organ systems. The negative correlation between aorta copper concentrations and the severity of atherosclerotic lesions suggests a vicious cycle between copper reduction and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. These changes in copper homeostasis would be additive to atherosclerosis as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in humans.},

abstract = {HYPOTHESIS AND PREDICTIONS: Here, we claim that amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation is a protective mechanism that ultimately fails. We predict that more Abeta accumulates in regions with higher rates of glucose metabolism, reaching a maximum followed by progression of pathology. BACKGROUND: Abeta accumulation is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but the accumulation does not correlate with cognitive decline, unlike the rates of glucose metabolism. STRATEGY: We compared averaged and individual estimates of regional binding potentials of [(11) C]Pittsburgh compound B to regionally averaged and individual values of metabolism of [(18) F]fluorodeoxyglucose in brain regions of volunteers with AD. SIGNIFICANCE: The claim explains the cognitive decline in some patients at a significantly lower level of Abeta deposition than in other patients, as well as the presence of cognitively healthy individuals with high Abeta accumulation. With further support of the hypothesis, the significance of Abeta accumulation in brains of patients with AD may require revision.},

abstract = {Copper toxicosis is frequently encountered in various dog breeds. A number of differences and similarities occur between Wilson disease and copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers, caused by a mutation in the COMMD1 gene, and copper toxicosis in Labrador retrievers, caused by mutations in both ATP7A and ATP7B gene. First the specific population structure of dog breeds is explained with reference to its applicability for genetic investigations. The relatively large body size (variable from less than 1 kg to over 50 kg) and life-span (over 10 years) of dogs facilitates preclinical studies on safety on long-term effects of novel procedures. Then copper toxicosis in the two dog breeds is described in detail with an emphasis on the functions of the causative proteins. Some of the advantages of this species for preclinical studies are described with an example of liver stem cell transplantations in COMMD1 deficient dogs. Since the genetic background of copper toxicosis in other dogs breeds has not yet been elucidated, it is conceivable that novel copper-related gene products or modifier genes will be discovered. About a century after the Novel prize was awarded to the research on dogs (Pavlov), dogs are in spotlight again as important preclinical model animals.},

abstract = {Simple Summary: This work compiles the current state of knowledge regarding zinc requirements of healthy dogs and biomarkers of zinc status. To ensure an adequate zinc status, it is important to know the zinc content of foods and their bioavailability to assess the need and the ideal supplementation strategy regarding levels and sources of additives in complete dog foods. As zinc is required for enzymatic, structural, and regulatory functions in the animal body, its nutritional status has been associated with several pathologies that may be due to, or exacerbated by, a deficit of dietary zinc supply. Abstract: Zinc is an essential trace element, required for enzymatic, structural, and regulatory functions. As body reserves are scarce, an adequate zinc status relies on proper dietary supply and efficient homeostasis. Several biomarkers have been proposed that enable the detection of poor zinc status, but more sensitive and specific ones are needed to detect marginal deficiencies. The zinc content of commercial dry dog foods has great variability, with a more frequent non-compliance with the maximum authorized limit than with the nutritional requirement. The bioavailability of dietary zinc also plays a crucial role in ensuring an adequate zinc status. Despite controversial results, organic zinc sources have been considered more bioavailable than inorganic sources, albeit the zinc source effect is more evident after a restriction period of dietary zinc. Many disorders have been associated with inadequate zinc status, not being clear whether the occurrence of the disease is the consequence or the cause. This review presents data on zinc requirements and biomarkers for zinc status, that can be applied for the development of supplementation strategies of zinc in complete pet foods. Moreover, it provides an understanding of the role zinc plays in the health of dogs, and how altered zinc status affects diseases in dogs.},

abstract = {Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. Diagnosis depends primarily on clinical features, biochemical parameters and the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring. Genetic analysis for mutations within ATP7B is a convincing diagnostic tool. The traditional treatment for WD includes chelation of excessive copper accumulation and reduction of copper intake. Medical therapy is effective but WD is not yet curable. Liver transplantation is especially helpful for patients who fail to respond to medical therapy or present with fulminant liver failure, although evaluation of its long-term effect are still in need.},

abstract = {Ceruloplasmin is a plasma protein that functions as a copper transporter. Epidemiological studies have indicated an association between the concentration of this protein and risk for cardiovascular disease. The mechanism for the involvement of ceruloplasmin in cardiovascular disease and other conditions is not yet clear, although it is widely accepted that the role played by ceruloplasmin in facilitating or counteracting oxidative stress is central. We review here some of the studies on this issue and try to calm down the duel between the claims supporting the oxidant or the antioxidant effects of ceruloplasmin through a clear-cut analysis of the available data. Our conclusion is that a verdict regarding the pathogenetic involvement of ceruloplasmin in cardiovascular disease should await further research.},

abstract = {Copper is essential for normal growth and development of human organisms. The role of copper as a cofactor of important metabolic enzymes, such as cytochrome c oxidase, superoxide dismutase, lysyl oxidase, dopamine--hydroxylase, and many others, has been well established. In recent years, new regulatory roles of copper have emerged. Accumulating evidence points to the involvement of copper in lipid metabolism, antimicrobial defense, neuronal activity, resistance of tumor cells to platinum-based chemotherapeutic drugs, kinase-mediated signal transduction, and other essential cellular processes. For many of these processes, the precise mechanism of copper action remains to be established. Nevertheless, it is increasingly clear that many regulatory and signaling events are associated with changes in the intracellular localization and abundance of copper transporters, as well as distinct compartmentalization of copper itself. In this review, we discuss current data on regulation of the localization and abundance of copper transporters in response to metabolic and signaling events in human cells. Regulation by kinase-mediated phosphorylation will be addressed along with the emerging area of the redox-driven control of copper transport. We highlight mechanistic questions that await further testing.},

abstract = {The relationship between sarcopenia and the long-term risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unclear. This study recruited a large prospective Caucasian cohort from the UK Biobank. Participants were assessed at baseline with handgrip strength and muscle mass and were categorized into groups of non-sarcopenia, probable sarcopenia, and confirmed sarcopenia. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model were used to explore the association between sarcopenia and the incidence of AF. The genetic predisposition of AF was assessed by polygenic risk score. Sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the results. A total of 384,433 participants with a median age of 58 years and 54.3% women were enrolled in this study. There were 24,007 cases of new-onset AF over a median follow-up of 12.56 years. The groups of non-sarcopenia, probable sarcopenia, and confirmed sarcopenia accounted for 22,290 (6.1%), 1665 (9.2%), and 52 (11.9%) cases, respectively. Compared with the non-sarcopenia group, participants with probable sarcopenia or confirmed sarcopenia had an 8% (95% CI, 1.03-1.14) or 61% (95% CI, 1.23-2.12) higher risk of AF incidence. The findings remained robust in multiple sensitivity analyses, such as subgroup analysis and further adjustment of genetic predisposition. Notably, the association between sarcopenia and a high AF risk was more pronounced in younger participants, women, and those with valvular heart disease. In conclusion, sarcopenia was associated with a high long-term risk of AF in Caucasians, supporting sarcopenia as a new independent risk factor of AF.},

abstract = {Of the seven amino acids required by Clostridium botulinum type E, tryptophan is the most essential and may provide the cell with nitrogen. The addition of excess tryptophan (10-20 mM) or other nitrogenous nutrients to minimal growth medium markedly decreased toxin formation but did not affect growth in C. botulinum type E. On the other hand, the addition of an enzymatic digest of casein (NZ Case) stimulated toxin formation and overcame repression by tryptophan. Immunoblots of proteins in culture fluids using antibodies to type E toxin indicated that tryptophan-repressed cultures produced less neurotoxin protein. Inhibitors of neurotoxin did not accumulate in cultures grown in minimal medium supplemented with high tryptophan. The results suggest that tryptophan availability in foods or in the intestine may be important for toxin formation by C. botulinum type E.},

abstract = {In manufacturing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), it is crucial to be able to predict how process conditions and supplements affect productivity and quality attributes, especially glycosylation. Supplemental inputs, such as amino acids and trace metals in the media, are reported to affect cell metabolism and glycosylation; quantifying their effects is essential for effective process development. We aim to present and validate, through a commercially relevant cell culture process, a technique for modeling such effects efficiently. While existing models can predict mAb production or glycosylation dynamics under specific process configurations, adapting them to new processes remains challenging, because it involves modifying the model structure and often requires some mechanistic understanding. Here, a modular modeling technique for adapting an existing model for a fed-batch Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture process without structural modifications or mechanistic insight is presented. Instead, data is used, obtained from designed experimental perturbations in media supplementation, to train and validate a supplemental input effect model, which is used to patch the existing model. The combined model can be used for model-based process development to improve productivity and to meet product quality targets more efficiently. The methodology and analysis are generally applicable to other CHO cell lines and cell types.},

abstract = {The high-affinity copper transporter CTR1 is encoded by CTR1 (SLC31A1), a gene locus for which no detailed genotype-phenotype correlations have previously been reported. We describe identical twin male infants homozygous for a novel missense variant NM_001859.4:c.284 G > A (p.Arg95His) in CTR1 with a distinctive autosomal recessive syndrome of infantile seizures and neurodegeneration, consistent with profound central nervous system copper deficiency. We used clinical, biochemical and molecular methods to delineate the first recognized examples of human CTR1 deficiency. These included clinical phenotyping, brain imaging, assays for copper, cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), and mitochondrial respiration, western blotting, cell transfection experiments, confocal and electron microscopy, protein structure modeling and fetal brain and cerebral organoid CTR1 transcriptome analyses. Comparison with two other critical mediators of cellular copper homeostasis, ATP7A and ATP7B, genes associated with Menkes disease and Wilson disease, respectively, revealed that expression of CTR1 was highest. Transcriptome analyses identified excitatory neurons and radial glia as brain cell types particularly enriched for copper transporter transcripts. We also assessed the effects of Copper Histidinate in the patients' cultured cells and in the patients, under a formal clinical protocol. Treatment normalized CCO activity and enhanced mitochondrial respiration in vitro, and was associated with modest clinical improvements. In combination with present and prior studies, these infants' clinical, biochemical and molecular phenotypes establish the impact of this novel variant on copper metabolism and cellular homeostasis and illuminate a crucial role for CTR1 in human brain development. CTR1 deficiency represents a newly defined inherited disorder of brain copper metabolism.},

abstract = {Copper serves as an essential cofactor for a variety of proteins in all living organisms. Previously, we described a human gene (CTR1;SLC31A1) that encodes a high-affinity copper-uptake protein and hypothesized that this protein is required for copper delivery to mammalian cells. Here, we test this hypothesis by inactivating the Ctr1 gene in mice by targeted mutagenesis. We observe early embryonic lethality in homozygous mutant embryos and a deficiency in copper uptake in the brains of heterozygous animals. Ctr1/ embryos can be recovered at E8.5 but are severely developmentally retarded and morphologically abnormal. Histological analysis reveals discontinuities and variable thickness in the basement membrane of the embryonic region and an imperfect Reichert's membrane, features that are likely due to lack of activity in the collagen cross-linking cupro-enzyme lysyl oxidase. A collapsed embryonic cavity, the absence of an allantois, retarded mesodermal migration, and increased cell death are also apparent. In the brains of heterozygous adult mice, which at 16 months are phenotypically normal, copper is reduced to approximately half compared with control littermates, implicating CTR1 as the required port for copper entry into at least this organ. A study of the spatial and temporal expression pattern of Ctr1 during mouse development and adulthood further shows that CTR1 is ubiquitously transcribed with highest expression observed in the specialized epithelia of the choroid plexus and renal tubules and in connective tissues of the eye, ovary, and testes. We conclude that CTR1 is the primary avenue for copper uptake in mammalian cells.},

abstract = {Articular cartilage remains among the most difficult tissues to regenerate due to its poor self-repair capacity. The lysyl oxidase family (LOX; also termed as protein-lysine 6-oxidase), mainly consists of lysyl oxidase (LO) and lysyl oxidase-like 1-4 (LOXL1-LOXL4), has been traditionally defined as cuproenzymes that are essential for stabilization of extracellular matrix, particularly cross-linking of collagen and elastin. LOX is essential in the musculoskeletal system, particularly cartilage. LOXs-mediated collagen cross-links are essential for the functional integrity of articular cartilage. Appropriate modulation of the expression or activity of certain LOX members selectively may become potential promising strategy for cartilage repair. In the current review, we summarized the advances of LOX in cartilage homeostasis and functioning, as well as copper-mediated activation of LOX through hypoxia-responsive signaling axis during recent decades. Also, the molecular signaling network governing LOX expression has been summarized, indicating that appropriate modulation of hypoxia-responsive-signaling-directed LOX expression through manipulation of bioavailability of copper and oxygen is promising for further clinical implications of cartilage regeneration, which has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for cartilage rejuvenation in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Therefore, targeted regulation of copper-mediated hypoxia-responsive signalling axis for selective modulation of LOX expression may become potential effective therapeutics for enhanced cartilage regeneration and rejuvenation in future clinical implications.},

abstract = {This retrospective study included 222 dogs suspected to have tracheal collapse (TC) and examined between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2015. Fluoroscopic and radiographic images and medical records were evaluated to investigate the fluoroscopic characteristics of TC and cervical lung herniation (CLH), and to determine their relationships to various influencing. Grade of TC, existence of tracheal kinking, location of CLH (right or left side), and grade of CLH were evaluated fluoroscopically. One hundred ninety-nine dogs (89.6%) were diagnosed with TC. Presence of TC was not associated with the patients' cough history; however, CLH was positively correlated with cough history (odds ratio [OR], 2.896; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.556 to 5.390) and was affected by tracheal kinking (OR, 3.841; 95% CI, 1.884 to 7.831). Chronic cough was not related with CLH. Since TC can be observed in patients without a history of cough, presence of TC should be ruled out by using physical examination and diagnostic imaging. Although CLH is associated with a history of cough, it is a common appearance in dogs, and transient coughing can elicit CLH in patients without a history of cough.},

abstract = {Elevated levels of homocysteine (Hcy) (known as hyperhomocysteinemia HHcy) are involved in dilated cardiomyopathy. Hcy chelates copper and impairs copper-dependent enzymes. Copper deficiency has been linked to cardiovascular disease. We tested the hypothesis that copper supplement regresses left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction in pressure overload DCM mice hearts. The mice were grouped as sham, sham + Cu, aortic constriction (AC), and AC + Cu. Aortic constriction was performed by transverse aortic constriction. The mice were treated with or without 20 mg/kg copper supplement in the diet for 12 weeks. The cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and electrocardiography. The matrix remodeling was assessed by measuring matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and lysyl oxidase (LOX) by Western blot analyses. The results suggest that in AC mice, cardiac function was improved with copper supplement. TIMP-1 levels decreased in AC and were normalized in AC + Cu. Although MMP-9, TIMP-3, and LOX activity increased in AC and returned to baseline value in AC + Cu, copper supplement showed no significant effect on TIMP-4 activity after pressure overload. In conclusion, our data suggest that copper supplement helps improve cardiac function in a pressure overload dilated cardiomyopathic heart.},

abstract = {The trace element copper is indispensable for all aerobic life forms. Its ability to cycle between two oxidation states, Cu1+ and Cu2+, has been harnessed by a wide array of metalloenzymes that catalyze electron transfer reactions. The metabolic needs for copper are sustained by a complex series of transporters and carrier proteins that regulate its intracellular accumulation and distribution in both pathogenic microbes and their animal hosts. However, copper is also potentially toxic due in part to its ability to generate reactive oxygen species. Recent studies suggest that the macrophage phagosome accumulates copper during bacterial infection, which may constitute an important mechanism of killing. Bacterial countermeasures include the up-regulation of copper export and detoxification genes during infection, which studies suggest are important determinants of virulence. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments that suggest an emerging role for copper as an unexpected component in determining the outcome of host-pathogen interactions.},

abstract = {Copper is an essential micronutrient for both pathogens and the animal hosts they infect. However, copper can also be toxic in cells due to its redox properties and ability to disrupt active sites of metalloproteins, such as Fe-S enzymes. Through these toxic properties, copper is an effective antimicrobial agent and an emerging concept in innate immunity is that the animal host intentionally exploits copper toxicity in antimicrobial weaponry. In particular, macrophages can attack invading microbes with high copper and this metal is also elevated at sites of lung infection. In addition, copper levels in serum rise during infection with a wide array of pathogens. To defend against this toxic copper, the microbial intruder is equipped with a battery of copper detoxification defenses that promote survival in the host, including copper exporting ATPases and copper binding metallothioneins. However, it is important to remember that copper is also an essential nutrient for microbial pathogens and serves as important cofactor for enzymes such as cytochrome c oxidase for respiration, superoxide dismutase for anti-oxidant defense and multi-copper oxidases that act on metals and organic substrates. We therefore posit that the animal host can also thwart pathogen growth by limiting their copper nutrients, similar to the well-documented nutritional immunity effects for starving microbes of essential zinc, manganese and iron micronutrients. This review provides both sides of the copper story and evaluates how the host can exploit either copper-the-toxin or copper-the-nutrient in antimicrobial tactics at the host-pathogen battleground.},

abstract = {As an essential nutrient, coppers redox properties are both beneficial and toxic to cells. Therefore, leveraging the characteristics of copper-dependent diseases or using copper toxicity to treat copper-sensitive diseases may offer new strategies for specific disease treatments. In particular, copper concentration is typically higher in cancer cells, making copper a critical limiting nutrient for cancer cell growth and proliferation. Hence, intervening in copper metabolism specific to cancer cells may become a potential tumor treatment strategy, directly impacting tumor growth and metastasis. In this review, we discuss the metabolism of copper in the body and summarize research progress on the role of copper in promoting tumor cell growth or inducing programmed cell death in tumor cells. Additionally, we elucidate the role of copper-related drugs in cancer treatment, intending to provide new perspectives for cancer treatment.},

It was generated from expert opinion and information gathered from searching of PubMed for manuscripts on CH, the Veterinary Information Network for abstracts and conference proceeding from annual meetings of the American College of Veterinary Medicine and the European College of Veterinary Medicine, and selected manuscripts from the human literature on CH. The panel recognizes that the diagnosis and treatment of CH in the dog is a complex process that requires integration of clinical presentation with clinical pathology, diagnostic imaging, and hepatic biopsy. Essential to this process is an index of suspicion for CH, knowledge of how to best collect tissue samples, access to a pathologist with experience in assessing hepatic histopathology, knowledge of reasonable medical interventions, and a strategy for monitoring treatment response and complications.},

The rats were divided into eight groups and fed different diets with or without supplement of 5% taurine and 150-600 ppm copper for 2 months. It was found that the levels of copper and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver, and the activities of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) in the plasma of rats were increased with the increasing dose of copper. However, the levels of copper and MDA, and the enzyme activities of AST and ALT in the rats fed with supplement of taurine were significantly lower than in the rats fed without supplement of taurine. The level of copper in the faeces of rats treated with taurine and copper was higher than that of rats treated with copper alone. It indicated that taurine might play a role in reducing the toxic effect of copper in rats.},

abstract = {The Przewalskis gazelles in the Hudong area of the Qinghai Lake area in China were affected by an ailment characterized by pica, emaciation, dyskinesia, loss of appetite, and anemia. Concentrations of copper (Cu) in soil and forage from affected and unaffected areas were similar and within the normal range, but concentrations of sulfur (S) in soil and forage were significantly higher (P < 0.01) in affected than in unaffected areas. Concentrations of Cu in blood, hair, and liver from the affected Przewalskis gazelles were significantly lower (P < 0.01) than those in healthy animals. Affected Przewalskis gazelles showed a hypochromic microcytic anemia and a low level of ceruloplasmin. Oral administration of copper sulphate (CuSO4) prevented and cured the disease. We conclude that the disorder of Przewalskis gazelles was caused by secondary Cu deficiency, mainly due to high S content in forage.},

abstract = {Background:: Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) refers to a condition in which structural integrity of cartilaginous wall of trachea is lost. Excessive dynamic airway collapse (EDAC) is characterized by excessive invagination of posterior wall of trachea. In both these conditions, airway lumen gets compromised, especially during expiration, which can lead to symptoms such as breathlessness, cough, and wheezing. Both these conditions can be present in obstructive lung diseases; TBM due to chronic airway inflammation and EDAC due to dynamic compressive forces during expiration. The present study was planned with the hypothesis that TBM/EDAC could also produce expiratory wheeze in patients with obstructive airway disorders. Hence, prevalence and factors affecting presence of this entity in patients with obstructive airway diseases were the aims and objectives of this study. Materials and Methods:: Twenty-five patients with obstructive airway disorders (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] or bronchial asthma), who were stable on medical management, but having persistent expiratory wheezing, were included in the study. They were evaluated for TBM/EDAC by bronchoscopy and computed tomographic scan of chest. The presence of TBM/EDAC was correlated with variables including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking index, level of dyspnea, and severity of disease. Results:: Mean age of the patients was 62.7 7.81 years. Out of 25 patients, 14 were males. TBM/EDAC was found in 40% of study subjects. Age, sex, BMI, severity of disease, frequency of exacerbations and radiological findings etc., were not found to have any association with presence of TBM/EDAC. Conclusion:: TBM/EDAC is common in patients with obstructive airway disorders and should be evaluated in these patients, especially with persistent expiratory wheezing as diagnosis of this entity could provide another treatment option in these patients with persistent symptoms despite medical management.},

abstract = {Copper is essential for life processes like energy metabolism, reactive oxygen species detoxification, iron uptake, and signaling in eukaryotic organisms. Mitochondria gather copper for the assembly of cuproenzymes such as the respiratory complex IV, cytochrome c oxidase, and the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 1. In this regard, copper plays a role in mitochondrial function and signaling involving bioenergetics, dynamics, and mitophagy, which affect cell fate by means of metabolic reprogramming. In mammals, copper homeostasis is tightly regulated by the liver. However, cellular copper levels are tissue specific. Copper imbalances, either overload or deficiency, have been associated with many diseases, including anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, as well as tumor development and cancer aggressivity. Consistently, new pharmacological developments have been addressed to reduce or exacerbate copper levels as potential cancer therapies. This review goes over the copper source, distribution, cellular uptake, and its role in mitochondrial function, metabolic reprograming, and cancer biology, linking copper metabolism with the field of regenerative medicine and cancer.},

abstract = {Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been in the literature and news because of the recent opinion-based journal articles and public releases by regulatory agencies. DCM is commonly associated with a genetic predisposition in certain dog breeds and can also occur secondary to other diseases and nutritional deficiencies. Recent communications in veterinary journals have discussed a potential relationship between grain-free and/or novel protein diets to DCM, citing a subjective increase in DCM in dog breeds that are not known to have a genetic predisposition for the disease. This literature review describes clinical presentations of DCM, common sequelae, treatment and preventative measures, histopathologic features, and a discussion of the varied etiological origins of the disease. In addition, current literature limitations are addressed, in order to ascertain multiple variables leading to the development of DCM. Future studies are needed to evaluate one variable at a time and to minimize confounding variables and speculation. Furthermore, to prevent sampling bias with the current FDA reports, the veterinary community should be asked to provide information for all cases of DCM in dogs. This should include cases during the same time period, regardless of the practitioners proposed etiology, due to no definitive association between diets with specific characteristics, such as, but not limited to, grain-free diets and those containing legumes, novel protein diets, and those produced by small manufacturers to DCM in dogs. In summary, in order to determine if certain ingredients, categories of diets, or manufacturing processes are related to an increased risk of DCM, further studies investigating these variables are necessary.},

abstract = {Hypothyroidism is a risk factor of heart failure (HF) in the general population. However, the relationship between hypothyroidism and clinical outcomes in patients with established HF is still inconclusive.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association of hypothyroidism and all-cause mortality as well as cardiac death and/or hospitalization in patients with HF. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases for studies of hypothyroidism and clinical outcomes in patients with HF published up to the end of January 2015. Random-effects models were used to estimate summary relative risk (RR) statistics. We included 13 articles that reported RR estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for hypothyroidism with outcomes in patients with HF. For the association of hypothyroidism with all-cause mortality and with cardiac death and/or hospitalization, the pooled RR was 1.44 (95% CI: 1.291.61) and 1.37 (95% CI: 1.221.55), respectively. However, the association disappeared on adjustment for B-type natriuretic protein level (RR 1.17, 95% CI: 0.901.52) and in studies of patients with mean age <65 years (RR 1.23, 95% CI: 0.881.76).We found hypothyroidism associated with increased all-cause mortality as well as cardiac death and/or hospitalization in patients with HF. Further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for hypothyroidism may be needed for patients with HF.},

abstract = {Flat trachea syndrome, commonly known as tracheobronchomalacia, is a central airway disease characterised by excessive expiratory collapse of the tracheobronchial posterior membrane due to weakness in the airway walls. Patients present with symptoms such as chronic cough, dyspnoea and recurrent respiratory tract infections, which are often attributed to more common conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The term Flat Trachea Syndrome was first proposed by Niranjan and Marzouk in 2010 following a retrospective study of 28 patients with the condition who underwent surgery for it. The authors advocated the term due to the primary abnormality being collapse of the posterior membranous wall of the central airways as opposed to softening of the tracheal cartilage (tracheobronchomalacia), which they proposed is a misnomer. We present a rare case of a patient with flat trachea syndrome on a history of COPD who initially presented with recurrent respiratory tract infections.},

abstract = {A 20-month-old Quarter Horse stallion was admitted for evaluation of labored breathing, honking cough, and bilateral epistaxis that were caused by pneumonia and collapsed trachea. A transtracheal aspiration revealed highly cellular, serosanguineous fluid. Radiography revealed a patchy alveolar pattern and a narrowed tracheal lumen. Endoscopy confirmed narrowing of the tracheal lumen. Streptococcus zooepidemicus was isolated on culture of the transtracheal aspirate. The horse responded to penicillin treatment, and the tracheal collapse improved endoscopically after 4 days, with complete recovery within 1 year. Tracheal collapse has been reported to be a disease of older horses associated with degenerative cartilage. The findings in the horse of this report suggested that tracheal collapse may result from inflammation secondary to pneumonia and, therefore, may be reversible.},

abstract = {Canine tracheal collapse is a progressive disease in small breed dogs resulting from chronic inflammation of the tracheal mucosal lining. Polyunsaturated fatty acid EAB-277 is one of the nutraceuticals that can alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a prognostic tool related to sympathovagal balance and oxidative stress level, which is widely used with cardiorespiratory diseases. However, the effect of EAB-277 on HRV in tracheal collapse dogs has rarely been investigated. In this study, 26 tracheal collapse dogs were divided into two groups. In the control group, the dogs received the standard treatment, whereas the dogs in the EAB-277 group received standard treatment combined with EAB-277. After being treated for 5 weeks, changes in radiographic findings, blood profiles, serum malondialdehyde, inflammatory markers, and HRV were evaluated. This study found that clinical signs were improved in both groups (p < 0.05). However, serum malondialdehyde (MDA), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) were decreased only in the EAB-277 group after treatment for five weeks (p < 0.05) and the mean percent change of MDA, IL-6, and TNF- at week five compared to baseline in the EAB-277 group was greater than in the control group (p < 0.05). Additionally, greater sympathovagal imbalance indicated by decreased standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals (SDNN) and standard deviation of the averaged R-R intervals for all 5-minutes segments (SDANN) was found in the control group at week five compared to baseline (P < 0.05), whereas EAB-277 improved SDNN and SDANN and decreased low frequency/high-frequency component (LF/HF ratio) after being treated for five weeks (P < 0.05). This study demonstrates that EAB-277 improves clinical signs and attenuates HRV impairment by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in tracheal collapse dogs.},

abstract = {In-stent restenosis can be caused by the activation, proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which affects long-term efficacy of interventional therapy. Copper (Cu) has been proved to accelerate the endothelialization and reduce thrombosis formation, but little is known about its inhibition effect on the excessive proliferation of VSMCs. In this study, 316L-Cu stainless steel and L605-Cu cobalt-based alloy with varying Cu content were fabricated and their effects on surface property, blood compatibility and VSMCs were studied in vitro and in vivo. CCK-8 assay and EdU assay indicated that the Cu-bearing metals had obvious inhibitory effect on proliferation of VSMCs. Blood clotting and hemolysis tests showed that the Cu-bearing metals had good blood compatibility. The inhibition effect of the Cu-bearing metals on migration of cells was detected by Transwell assay. Further studies showed that Cu-bearing metals significantly decreased the mRNA expressions of bFGF, PDGF-B, HGF, Nrf2, GCLC, GCLM, NQO1 and HO1. The phosphorylation of AKT and Nrf2 protein expressions in VSMCs were significantly decreased by Cu-bearing metals. Furthermore, it was also found that SC79 and TBHQ treatments could recover the protein expressions of phospho-AKT and Nrf2, and their downstream proteins as well. Moreover, 316L-Cu stent proved its inhibitory action on the proliferation of VSMCs in vivo. In sum, the results demonstrated that the Cu-bearing metals possessed apparent inhibitory effect on proliferation and migration of VSMCs via regulating the AKT/Nrf2/ARE pathway, showing the Cu-bearing metals as promising stent materials for long-term efficacy of implantation.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder impacting millions of people with cognitive impairment and affecting activities of daily living. The deposition of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins and accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) are the main pathological characteristics of AD. However, the actual causal process of AD is not yet identified. Oxidative stress occurs prior to amyloid Abeta plaque formation and tau phosphorylation in AD. The role of master antioxidant, glutathione, and metal ions (e.g., iron) in AD are the frontline area of AD research. Iron overload in specific brain regions in AD is associated with the rate of cognitive decline. We have presented the outcome from various interventional trials involving iron chelators intended to minimize the iron overload in AD. To date, however, no significant positive outcomes have been reported using iron chelators in AD and warrant further research.},

abstract = {Tissue injury provokes a series of events containing inflammation, new tissue formation and tissue remodeling which are regulated by the spatially and temporally coordinated organization. It is an evolutionarily conserved, multi-cellular, multi-molecular process via complex signalling network. Tissue injury disorders present grievous clinical problems and are likely to increase since they are generally associated with the prevailing diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. Although these dynamic responses vary not only for the different types of trauma but also for the different organs, a balancing act between the tissue degradation and tissue synthesis is the same. In this process, the degradation of old extracellular matrix (ECM) elements and new ones synthesis and deposition play an essential role, especially collagens. Lysyl oxidase (LOX) and four lysyl oxidase-like proteins are a group of enzymes capable of catalyzing cross-linking reaction of collagen and elastin, thus initiating the formation of covalent cross-links that insolubilize ECM proteins. In this way, LOX facilitates ECM stabilization through ECM formation, development, maturation and remodeling. This ability determines its potential role in tissue repair and regeneration. In this review, based on the current in vitro, animal and human in vivo studies which have shown the significant role of the LOXs in tissue repair, e.g., tendon regeneration, ligament healing, cutaneous wound healing, and cartilage remodeling, we focused on the role of the LOXs in inflammation phase, proliferation phase, and tissue remodeling phase of the repair process. By summarizing its healing role, we hope to shed light on the understanding of its potential in tissue repair and provide up to date therapeutic strategies towards related injuries.},

abstract = {Lysyl oxidase proteins (LOXs) are amine oxidases, which are mainly located in smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts and serve an important role in the formation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in a copper-dependent manner. Owing to the ability of LOX proteins to modulate crosslinking between collagens and to promote the deposition of other fibers, they serve crucially in organogenesis and the subsequent organ development, as well as disease initiation and progression. In addition, ECM formation significantly influences organ morphological formation in both cancer- and non-tumor-related diseases, in addition to cellular epigenetic transformation and migration, under the influence of LOXs. A number of different signaling pathways regulate the LOXs expression and their enzymatic activation. The tissue remodeling and transformation process shares some resemblance between oncogenesis and embryogenesis. Additionally the roles that LOXs serve appeared to be stressed during oncogenesis and tumor metastasis. It has also been indicated LOXs have a noteworthy role in non-tumor diseases. Nonetheless, the role of LOXs in systemic or local organ development and disease control remains unknown. In the present study, the essential roles that LOXs play in embryogenesis were unveiled partially, whereas the role of LOXs in organ or systematic development requires further investigations. The present review aimed to discuss the roles of members of the LOX family in the context of the remodeling of organogenesis and organ development. In addition, the consequences of the malfunction of these proteins related to the development of abnormalities and resulting diseases is discussed.},

abstract = {The varied reactions of the host to infection, inflammation, or trauma are collectively known as the acute-phase response and encompass a wide range of pathophysiological responses such as pyrexia, leukocytosis, hormone alterations, and muscle protein depletion combining to minimize tissue damage while enhancing the repair process. The mechanism for stimulation of hepatic production of acute-phase proteins is by proinflammatory cytokines. The functions of positive acute-phase proteins (APP) are regarded as important in optimization and trapping of microorganism and their products, in activating the complement system, in binding cellular remnants like nuclear fractions, in neutralizing enzymes, scavenging free hemoglobin and radicals, and in modulating the hosts immune response. APP can be used as diagnostic tool in many diseases like bovine respiratory syncytial virus, prostate cancer, bronchopneumonia, multiple myeloma, mastitis, Streptococcus suis infection, starvation, or lymphatic neoplasia. Thus, acute-phase proteins may provide an alternative means of monitoring animal health.},

abstract = {Ceruloplasmin (CP) is a multicopper oxidase and antioxidant that is mainly produced in the liver. CP not only plays a crucial role in the metabolic balance of copper and iron through its oxidase function but also exhibits antioxidant activity. In addition, CP is an acute-phase protein. In addition to being associated with aceruloplasminemia and neurodegenerative diseases such as Wilsons disease, Alzheimers disease, and Parkinsons disease, CP also plays an important role in metabolic diseases, which are caused by metabolic disorders and vigorous metabolism, mainly including diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, etc. Based on the physiological functions of CP, we provide an overview of the association of type 2 diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, CP oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolism of copper and iron. Studies have shown that metabolic diseases are closely related to systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and disorders of copper and iron metabolism. Therefore, we conclude that CP, which can reduce the formation of free radicals in tissues, can be induced during inflammation and infection, and can correct the metabolic disorder of copper and iron, has protective and diagnostic effects on metabolic diseases.},

abstract = {Ceruloplasmin (ferroxidase) is a copper-binding protein known to promote Fe2+ oxidation in plasma of mammals. Besides its classical ferroxidase activity, ceruloplasmin is known to catalyze the oxidation of various substrates, such as amines and catechols. Assays based on cyclic hydroxylamine oxidation are used to quantify and detect free radicals in biological samples ex vivo and in vitro. We show here that human ceruloplasmin promotes the oxidation of the cyclic hydroxylamine 1-hydroxy-3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine hydrochloride (CPH) and related probes in Chelex-treated phosphate buffer and rat serum. The reaction is suppressed by the metal chelators DTPA, EDTA and Desferal, while heparin and bathocuproine have no effect. Catalase or SOD additions do not interfere with the CPH-oxidation yield, demonstrating that free radicals are not involved in the CPH oxidation mediated by ceruloplasmin. Plasma samples immunodepleted of ceruloplasmin have lower levels of CPH oxidation, which confirms the role of ceruloplasmin (ferroxidase) as a biological oxidizing agent of cyclic hydroxylamines. In conclusion, we show that the ferroxidase activity of ceruloplasmin is a possible biological source of artifacts in the cyclic hydroxylamine-oxidation assay used for ROS detection and quantification.},

abstract = {Ceruloplasmin (CP) is the major copper transport protein in plasma, mainly produced by the liver. Glyco-sylphosphatidylinositol-linked CP (GPI-CP) is the predominant form expressed in astrocytes of the brain. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that CP is an essential protein in the body with multiple functions such as regulating the home-ostasis of copper and iron ions, ferroxidase activity, oxidizing organic amines, and preventing the formation of free radicals. In addition, as an acute-phase protein, CP is induced during inflammation and infection. The fact that patients with genetic disorder aceruloplasminemia do not suffer from tissue copper deficiency, but rather from disruptions in iron metabolism shows essential roles of CP in iron metabolism rather than copper. Furthermore, abnormal metabolism of metal ions and ox-idative stress are found in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Wilsons disease, Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease. Brain iron accumulation and decreased activity of CP have been shown to be associated with neurodegeneration. We hypothesize that CP may play a protective role in neurodegenerative diseases. However, whether iron accumulation is a cause or a result of neurodegeneration remains unclear. Further research on molecular mechanisms is required before a con-sensus can be reached regarding a neuroprotective role for CP in neurodegeneration. This review article summarizes the main physiological functions of CP and the current knowledge of its role in neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Objective: To explore the effect of amyloid- peptide (A) on mandibular condyle to develop a new treatment for postmenopausal women with Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis. Methods: A murine bone loss model was established by ovariectomy. Microstructure parameters of the condyle were measured by microcomputed tomography before and after intraperitoneal injection with A. Flow cytometry, Alizarin red staining, RT-qPCR assays, FITC/PI staining, Oil Red O staining and western blotting were used to evaluate the effect of A on the osteogenic differentiation of mouse bone marrow stromal stem cells (mBMSCs). Results: In vivo, condylar microstructure parameters increased. Serum osteoprotegerin and procollagen type 1N propeptide increased in a dose-dependent manner after the injection of A, which were opposite the changes observed in c-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen, tumor necrosis factor- and the high serum level of leptin. In vitro, A promoted calcium nodule formation in the cells. The expression of ALP, Runx2, osteorix and osteocalcin increased significantly. The expression of mRNAs related to the Wnt signaling pathway was significantly upregulated, which could be blocked by DKK1. Conclusion: A can reverse bone loss in the mandibular condyle in ovariectomized mice through promoting the osteogenic differentiation of mBMSCs via the Wnt pathway.},

abstract = {Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides accumulating in the brain are proposed to trigger Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for Abeta42 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for gamma-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in Abeta42, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on gamma-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We conducted kinetic analyses of gamma-secretase activity in cell-free systems in the presence of Abeta, as well as cell-based and ex vivo assays in neuronal cell lines, neurons, and brain synaptosomes to assess the impact of Abeta on gamma-secretases. We show that human Abeta42 peptides, but neither murine Abeta42 nor human Abeta17-42 (p3), inhibit gamma-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75, and pan-cadherin. Moreover, Abeta42 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in Abeta42 contribute to cellular toxicity via the gamma-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address Abeta toxicity in the context of gamma-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.},

abstract = {Mutations in the PSEN genes are the major cause of familial Alzheimer's disease, and presenilin (PS) is the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, which cleaves type I transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to release Abeta peptides. While PS plays an essential role in the protection of neuronal survival, PSEN mutations also increase the ratio of Abeta42/Abeta40. Thus, it remains unresolved whether PSEN mutations cause AD via a loss of its essential function or increases of Abeta42/Abeta40. Here, we test whether the knockin (KI) allele of Psen1 L435F, the most severe FAD mutation located closest to the active site of gamma-secretase, causes age-dependent cortical neurodegeneration independent of Abeta by crossing various Psen mutant mice to the App-null background. We report that removing Abeta completely through APP deficiency has no impact on the age-dependent neurodegeneration in Psen mutant mice, as shown by the absence of effects on the reduced cortical volume and decreases of cortical neurons at the ages of 12 and 18 mo. The L435F KI allele increases Abeta42/Abeta40 in the cerebral cortex while decreasing de novo production and steady-state levels of Abeta42 and Abeta40 in the presence of APP. Furthermore, APP deficiency does not alleviate elevated apoptotic cell death in the cerebral cortex of Psen mutant mice at the ages of 2, 12, and 18 mo, nor does it affect the progressive microgliosis in these mice. Our findings demonstrate that Psen1 mutations cause age-dependent neurodegeneration independent of Abeta, providing further support for a loss-of-function pathogenic mechanism underlying PSEN mutations.},

abstract = {Potent gastric acid suppression using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is common in clinical practice yet may have important effects on human health that are mediated through changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome. Acting through pH-dependent or pH-independent mechanisms, PPIs have the potential to alter the normal microbiota throughout the human gastrointestinal lumen. In the esophagus, PPIs change the normal bacterial milieu to decrease distal esophageal exposure to inflammatory Gram-negative bacteria which may lower the risk of Barrett's esophagus. In the stomach, PPIs alter the abundance and location of gastric Helicobacter pylori and other bacteria, which has implications for peptic ulcer disease and gastric malignancy. In the small bowel, PPIs cause polymicrobial small bowel bacterial overgrowth and have been associated with the diagnosis of celiac disease. In the colon, PPIs associate with incident but not recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, putatively through alterations in commensal colonic anaerobes. Our understanding of the effect of gastric acid suppression on the human gastrointestinal microbiome is incomplete but is rapidly advancing.},

abstract = {Hydrochloric acid is crucial in gastric physiology. In 1978 cimetidine, the first H2 antagonist of histamine receptors on the gastric parietal cell was introduced into therapy, inducing acid. Lasting the years, several studies focused on the potential relationship between inducing hypo-achlorhydria and risk of developing gastric cancer. In 1988 omeprazole, the first proton pump inhibitor, entered therapy. In 1996, Kuipers underlined the danger of progression of chronic atrophic gastritis in subjects taking PPIs. In 2018, one paper from Korea and an another on from Sweden suggested a possible relationship between long-term PPI therapy and the development of gastric cancer. Over the years, several articles, meta-analyzes and population based focused on relationship between long-term of PPI use and the onset of gastric cancer, with conflicting results. As reported, the presence of bias in the collection of cases, in particular concerning the evaluation of the H.p. status and presence of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia in subjects treated with PPI, can lead to noticeable errors in the results and conclusions, as demonstrated in the literature by exhaustive methodological studies of pharmacoepidemiology. A possible bias in the collection of case histories is due to the fact that PPIs are often administered to dyspeptic patients, among which there are patients already carriers of gastric neoplasia: the so-called inverse causality. Literature data, amended by methodological bias (sampling errors, lack of comparative assessment of Hp status and atrophic gastritis) NOT support a causal relationship between long-term PPIs therapy and the onset of gastric cancer.

abstract = {Proton Pump Inhibitors are used widely to manage many gastric acid-related conditions such as gastroesophageal disease, gastritis, esophagitis, Barretts esophagus, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, peptic ulcer disease, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated ulcers, and Helicobacter pylori eradication, around the globe. This review article focuses on adverse effects associated with the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors. Various observational studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses have established the adverse effects associated with the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors including renal disorders (acute interstitial nephritis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease), cardiovascular risks (major adverse cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and stroke), fractures, infections (Clostridium difficile infection, community-acquired pneumonia, and Coronavirus disease 2019), micronutrient deficiencies (hypomagnesemia, anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia), hypergastrinemia, cancers (gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatic cancer), hepatic encephalopathy, and dementia. Clinicians including prescribers and pharmacists should be aware of the adverse effects of taking proton pump inhibitors for an extended period of time. In addition, the patients taking proton pump inhibitors for long-term should be monitored for the listed adverse effects. The American Gastroenterological association recommends a few non-pharmacological measures and the use of histamine 2 blockers to lessen gastrointestinal symptoms of gastroesophageal reflex disease and the utilization of proton pump inhibitors treatment if there is a definitive indication. Additionally, the American Gastroenterological associations Best Practice Advice statements emphasize deprescribing when there is no clear indication for proton pump inhibitors therapy.},

The rate of such DNA degradation was several times greater than that caused by riboflavin alone. The reaction was inhibited under anaerobic conditions, but oxygen could be replaced by the addition of H2O2. Riboflavin reduced Cu(II) to Cu(I), which was shown by using the Cu(I)-sequestering reagent neocuproine, to be an essential intermediate in the DNA degradation reaction.

abstract = {Riboflavin is known to generate superoxide anion (O2.-) and other reactive oxygen species in the presence of Cu(II) and light as well as cause fragmentation of DNA and protein in vitro. In the present study we examined the genotoxic effects of photoilluminated riboflavin in the presence of Cu(II). Using the phage inactivation assay, a significant decline in plaque-forming unit (PFU) is seen. Results of Ames testing have suggested that probably a frameshift mutation is caused by a riboflavin-Cu(II)-mediated reaction. Using neocuproine as a Cu(I) sequestering reagent, Cu(I) has been shown to be an essential intermediate generated in the reaction between Cu(II), photoilluminated riboflavin, and DNA. Results obtained with various scavengers of active oxygen species strongly suggest that the species predominantly responsible for DNA damage is oxygen (O2) in the singlet or triplet state, together with H2O2, hydroxyl radical, and hydroxyl ion, to a lesser extent. In the case of riboflavin, a ternary complex of DNA-drug-Cu(II) is presumably formed. A redox reaction, involving riboflavin and Cu(II) in the complex, may then occur with the formation of a DNA-oxidized riboflavin-Cu(I) complex. This probably acts as a catalyst for the oxidation of Cu (I) to Cu(II), during which molecular oxygen is reduced to generate a variety of active oxygen species. The probable mechanism for the generation of these reactive oxygen species has also been proposed.},

abstract = {The Fenton reaction, Fe(H(2)O)(6)(2+) + H(2)O(2) --> Oxidizing product, is of major importance in biology as the major cause of oxidative stress, and in advanced oxidation processes. It is commonly assumed that .OH is the product of the Fenton reaction. The results presented herein point out that .OH is indeed the oxidizing product in acidic solutions for [Fe(H(2)O)(6)(2+)] >[H(2)O(2)]; Fe(IV)(aq) is the active oxidizing product in neutral solutions; in slightly acidic solutions for [H(2)O(2)] >[Fe(H(2)O)(6)(2+)] a mixture of .OH and Fe(IV)(aq) is formed. However CO(3).(-) is the active oxidizing product in neutral solutions containing HCO(3)(-) even at low concentrations, i.e. under physiological conditions. The implications to our understanding of the origins of oxidative stress and of catalytic oxidations in advanced oxidation processes are discussed.},

abstract = {Oxidative stress and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption due to brain endothelial barrier dysfunction contribute to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), which is characterized by beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in senile plaques. Copper (Cu) is implicated in AD pathology and its levels are tightly controlled by several Cu transport proteins. However, their expression and role in AD, particularly in relation to brain endothelial barrier function remains unclear. In this study, we examined the expression of Cu transport proteins in the brains of AD mouse models as well as their involvement in Abeta42-induced brain endothelial barrier dysfunction. We found that the Cu uptake transporter CTR1 was upregulated, while the Cu exporter ATP7A was downregulated in the hippocampus of AD mouse models and in Abeta42-treated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). In the 5xFAD AD mouse model, Cu levels (assessed by ICP-MS) were elevated in the hippocampus. Moreover, in cultured hBMECs, Abeta42-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ROS-dependent loss in barrier function (measured by transendothelial electrical resistance), and tyrosine phosphorylation of CDH5 were all inhibited by either a membrane permeable Cu chelator or by knocking down CTR1 expression. These findings suggest that dysregulated expression of Cu transport proteins may lead to intracellular Cu accumulation in the AD brain, and that Abeta42 promotes ROS-dependent brain endothelial barrier dysfunction and CDH5 phosphorylation in a CTR1-Cu-dependent manner. Our study uncovers the critical role of Cu transport proteins in oxidative stress-related loss of BBB integrity in AD.},

abstract = {Disrupted systemic copper (Cu) homeostasis underlies neurodegenerative diseases with early symptoms including olfactory dysfunction. This study investigated the impact of Cu dyshomeostasis on olfactory function, adult neurogenesis, and neurochemical balance. Models of Cu deficiency (CuD) and Cu overload (CuO) were established by feeding adult rats with Cu-restricted diets plus ip. injection of a Cu chelator (ammonium tetrathiomolybdate) and excess Cu, respectively. CuD reduced Cu levels in the olfactory bulb (OB), subventricular zone (SVZ), rostral migratory stream (RMS), and striatum, while CuO increased Cu levels in these areas. The buried pellet test revealed both CuD and CuO prolonged the latency to uncover food. CuD increased neural proliferation and stem cells in the SVZ and newly differentiated neurons in the OB, whereas CuO caused opposite alterations, suggesting a switch-type function of Cu in regulating adult neurogenesis. CuO increased GABA in the OB, while both CuD and CuO reduced DOPAC, HVA, 5-HT and the DA turnover rate in olfactory-associated brain regions. Altered mRNA expression of Cu transport and storage proteins in tested brain areas were observed under both conditions. Together, results support an association between systemic Cu dyshomeostasis and olfactory dysfunction. Specifically, altered adult neurogenesis along the SVZ-RMS-OB pathway and neurochemical imbalance could be the factors that may contribute to olfactory dysfunction.},

abstract = {Peroxyacetic acid (PAA), as an oxidizing agent, has gained significant attention in the field of advanced oxidation because of its low toxicity and high degradation capacity. In this study, cobalt-iron-based Prussian blue analogs (Co-PBAs) were utilized for the first time to activate PAA for tetracycline degradation. In the Co-PBAs/PAA system, organic radicals (RO*) and high-valent metal oxides are mainly produced. TC is efficiently removed in a wide pH range (5-9) and a variety of interferences (Cl(-), SO(4)(2-), bicarbonate ions (HCO(3)(-)), humic acid, and the actual water bodies) in water bodies due to the specificity of RO*. Interestingly, the catalytic rate of the Co-PBAs/PAA system was significantly accelerated in the presence of HCO(3)(-) (k(obs) increasing from 0.171min(-1) to 0.534min(-1)). This enhancement is attributed to the reaction between HCO(3)(-) and PAA, and carbonate radicals (*CO(3)(-)) and acetyl peroxyl radicals (CH(3)C(O)OO*) are generated and then react with the phenolic hydroxyl group of TC. In this study, the mechanism of PAA activation by Co-PBAs was revealed, and PAA-based advanced oxidation process enhanced by HCO(3)(-) was provided for the removal of pollutants from wastewater.},

abstract = {Foods that are rich in organosulfides are highly regarded for their broad range of functions in disease prevention and health promotion since ancient time yet modern scientific study, particularly clinical studies could not agree with traditional wisdom. One of the complexities is due to the labile nature of organosulfides, which are often transformed to different structures depending on the processing conditions. The recent evidence on polysulfides as H2S donors may open up a new avenue for establishing structure and health promotion activity relationship. To put this development into perspective, we carried out a review on the recent progress on the chemistry and biochemistry of organopolysulfides with emphasis on their cardioprotective property. First, we briefly surveyed the foods that are rich in polysulfides and their structural diversity. This is followed by in-depth discussion on the chemical transformations of polysulfides under various processing conditions. We further reviewed the potential action mechanisms of polysulfides in cardioprotection through: (a) hydrogen sulfide releasing activity; (b) radical scavenging activity; and (c) activity in enzyme inhibition and intervention of gene regulation pathways. Based on the literature trend, we can conclude that the emerging concept of organopolysulfides as naturally occurring H2S donors is intriguing and warrants further research to establish the structure and activity relationship of the organopolysulfides as H2S donors.},

abstract = {Sulfur is a vital element that all living things require, being a component of proteins and other bio-organic substances. The various kinds and varieties of microbes in nature allow for the transformation of this element. It also should be emphasized that volatile sulfur compounds are typically present in food in trace amounts. Life cannot exist without sulfur, yet it also poses a potential health risk. The colons sulfur metabolism, which is managed by eukaryotic cells, is much better understood than the S metabolism in gastrointestinal bacteria. Numerous additional microbial processes are anticipated to have an impact on the content and availability of sulfated compounds, as well as intestinal S metabolism. Hydrogen sulfide is the sulfur derivative that has attracted the most attention in relation to colonic health, but it is still unclear whether it is beneficial or harmful. Several lines of evidence suggest that sulfate-reducing bacteria or exogenous hydrogen sulfide may be the root cause of intestinal ailments, including inflammatory bowel diseases and colon cancer. Taurine serves a variety of biological and physiological purposes, including roles in inflammation and protection, additionally, low levels of taurine can be found in bodily fluids, and taurine is the primary sulfur component present in muscle tissue (serum and urine). The aim of this scoping review was to compile data from the most pertinent scientific works about S compounds' existence in food and their metabolic processes. The importance of S compounds in various food products and how these compounds can impact metabolic processes are both stressed in this paper.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interleaflet haemorrhage (IH) plays a well-recognized detrimental role in calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD). However, IH-induced fibro-osteogenic responses in valvular interstitial cells (VICs) appear to be triggered under specific pathological conditions. Iron deficiency (ID), a common co-morbidity in CAVD, may influence these responses. This study investigated the relationship between ID and pathological changes associated with CAVD, and its effects on IH-mediated fibro-osteogenic differentiation of VICs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two independent studies were conducted, including 2,495 patients in the discovery study and 34 in the validation study. Our data demonstrated that ID was associated with CAVD severity and progression, particularly in an age-dependent manner. Based on these clinical findings, immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses revealed that TFR1, a key iron import transporter, was significantly upregulated in human calcified aortic valves. Concurrently, iron accumulation was detected by Perl's staining in both calcific and non-calcific valve sections. In vitro, VICs cultured with human serum from ID patients showed red blood cell lysis-induced iron overload and fibro-calcific differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: ID triggers TFR1-mediated intracellular iron overload, leading to fibrosis and calcification in human VICs, thereby contributing to IH-mediated valve remodeling and calcification. These findings supported the potential role of monitoring and correcting ID to slow or prevent the progression of valvular calcification.},

abstract = {The hepatic content of amyloid beta (Abeta) decreases drastically in human and rodent cirrhosis highlighting the importance of understanding the consequences of Abeta deficiency in the liver. This is especially relevant in view of recent advances in anti-Abeta therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, it is shown that partial hepatic loss of Abeta in transgenic AD mice immunized with Abeta antibody 3D6 and its absence in amyloid precursor protein (APP) knockout mice (APP-KO), as well as in human liver spheroids with APP knockdown upregulates classical hallmarks of fibrosis, smooth muscle alpha-actin, and collagen type I. Abeta absence in APP-KO and deficiency in immunized mice lead to strong activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta), alpha secretases, NOTCH pathway, inflammation, decreased permeability of liver sinusoids, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Inversely, increased systemic and intrahepatic levels of Abeta42 in transgenic AD mice and neprilysin inhibitor LBQ657-treated wild-type mice protect the liver against carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4) )-induced injury. Transcriptomic analysis of CCl(4) -treated transgenic AD mouse livers uncovers the regulatory effects of Abeta42 on mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, and its onco-suppressive effects accompanied by reduced synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. Combined, these data reveal Abeta as an indispensable regulator of cell-cell interactions in healthy liver and a powerful protector against liver fibrosis.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically by cognitive decline and pathologically by the accumulation of amyloid--containing senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. A great deal of attention has focused on amyloid- as the major pathogenic mechanisms with the ultimate goal of using amyloid- lowering therapies as an avenue of treatment. Unfortunately, nearly a quarter century later, no tangible progress has been offered, whereas spectacular failure tends to be the most compelling. We have long contended, as has substantial literature, that proteinaceous accumulations are simply downstream and, often, endstage manifestations of disease. Their overall poor correlation with the level of dementia, and their presence in the cognitively intact is evidence that is often ignored as an inconvenient truth. Current research examining amyloid oligomers, therefore, will add copious details to what is, in essence, a reductionist distraction from upstream pleiotrophic processes such as oxidative stress, cell cycle dysfunction, and inflammation. It is now long overdue that the neuroscientists avoid the pitfall of perseverating on proteinopathies and recognize that the continued targeting of end stage lesions in the face of repeated failure, or worse, is a losing proposition.},

abstract = {Age is a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke. However, the influence of aging on coagulation parameters in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) remains unclear. A total of 775 samples were collected from 224 NVAF patients receiving apixaban, edoxaban or rivaroxaban. The samples were categorized into three age groups: (i) </= 64 years, (ii) 65-74 years, and (iii) >/= 75 years (apixaban: N = 48, 108, 119; edoxaban: N = 63, 68, 126; rivaroxaban: N = 115, 90, 38, respectively). Coagulation parameters including fibrinogen (Fbg), factor II, factor V, factor VII, factor X, and D-dimer, were compared between the three age groups for each drug. The slopes in the correlation between drug concentrations and modified diluted prothrombin time (mdPT) were also assessed. Fbg and factor V increased with age, while factor II and factor X decreased. Factor VII and D-dimer showed no significant differences across age categories. The slope in response to drug concentrations was similar between the age groups. In NVAF patients treated with apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, some coagulation parameters exhibited age-related variation. However, the response of mdPT to drug concentration was consistent across age categories.},

abstract = {Fibrinogen is an abundant protein synthesized in the liver, present in human blood plasma at concentrations ranging from 1.5-4 g/L in healthy individuals with a normal half-life of 3-5 days. With fibrin, produced by thrombin-mediated cleavage, fibrinogen plays important roles in many physiological processes. Indeed, the formation of a stable blood clot, containing polymerized and cross-linked fibrin, is crucial to prevent blood loss and drive wound healing upon vascular injury. A balance between clotting, notably the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, and fibrinolysis, the proteolytic degradation of the fibrin mesh, is essential. Disruption of this equilibrium can cause disease in distinct manners. While some pathological conditions are the consequence of altered levels of fibrinogen, others are related to structural properties of the molecule. The source of fibrinogen expression and the localization of fibrin(ogen) protein also have clinical implications. Low levels of fibrinogen expression have been detected in extra-hepatic tissues, including carcinomas, potentially contributing to disease. Fibrin(ogen) deposits at aberrant sites including the central nervous system or kidney, can also be pathological. In this review, we discuss disorders in which fibrinogen and fibrin are implicated, highlighting mechanisms that may contribute to disease.},

abstract = {Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors are commonly divided into prohemorrhagic (FII, FVII, FIX, and FX) and antithrombotic (protein C and protein S). Furthermore, another protein (protein Z) does not seem strictly correlated with blood clotting. As a consequence of this assumption, vitamin K-dependent defects were considered as hemorrhagic or thrombotic disorders. Recent clinical observations, and especially, recent advances in molecular biology investigations, have demonstrated that this was incorrect. In 2009, it was demonstrated that the mutation Arg338Leu in exon 8 of FIX was associated with the appearance of a thrombophilic state and venous thrombosis. The defect was characterized by a 10-fold increased activity in FIX activity, while FIX antigen was only slightly increased (FIX Padua). On the other hand, it was noted on clinical grounds that the thrombosis, mainly venous, was present in about 2% to 3% of patients with FVII deficiency. It was subsequently demonstrated that 2 mutations in FVII, namely, Arg304Gln and Ala294Val, were particularly affected. Both these mutations are type 2 defects, namely, they show low activity but normal or near-normal FVII antigen. More recently, in 2011-2012, it was noted that prothrombin defects due to mutations of Arg596 to Leu, Gln, or Trp in exon 15 cause the appearance of a dysprothrombinemia that shows no bleeding tendency but instead a prothrombotic state with venous thrombosis. On the contrary, no abnormality of protein C or protein S has been shown to be associated with bleeding rather than with thrombosis. These studies have considerably widened the spectrum and significance of blood coagulation studies.},

abstract = {Reduced sulfatide level is found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Here, we demonstrate that amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing regulates sulfatide synthesis and vice versa. Different cell culture models and transgenic mice models devoid of APP processing or in particular the APP intracellular domain (AICD) reveal that AICD decreases Gal3st1/CST expression and subsequently sulfatide synthesis. In return, sulfatide supplementation decreases Abeta generation by reducing beta-secretase (BACE1) and gamma-secretase processing of APP. Increased BACE1 lysosomal degradation leads to reduced BACE1 protein level in endosomes. Reduced gamma-secretase activity is caused by a direct effect on gamma-secretase activity and reduced amounts of gamma-secretase components in lipid rafts. Similar changes were observed by analyzing cells and mice brain samples deficient of arylsulfatase A responsible for sulfatide degradation or knocked down in Gal3st1/CST. In line with these findings, addition of sulfatides to brain homogenates of AD patients resulted in reduced gamma-secretase activity. Human brain APP level shows a significant negative correlation with GAL3ST1/CST expression underlining the in vivo relevance of sulfatide homeostasis in AD.},

abstract = {Our group and others have reported a series of studies showing that heavy burdens of diarrheal diseases in the formative first two years of life in children in urban shantytowns have profound consequences of impaired physical and cognitive development lasting into later childhood and schooling. Based on these previous studies showing that apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is relatively common in favela children, we review recent data suggesting a protective role for the APOE4 allele in the cognitive and physical development of children with heavy burdens of diarrhea in early childhood. Despite being a marker for cognitive decline with Alzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases later in life, APOE4 appears to be important for cognitive development under the stress of heavy diarrhea. The reviewed findings provide a potential explanation for the survival advantage in evolution of the thrifty APOE4 allele and raise questions about its implications for human development under life-style changes and environmental challenges.},

abstract = {Mitotic homologous recombination promotes genome stability through the precise repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other lesions that are encountered during normal cellular metabolism and from exogenous insults. As a result, homologous recombination repair is essential during proliferative stages in development and during somatic cell renewal in adults to protect against cell death and mutagenic outcomes from DNA damage. Mutations in mammalian genes encoding homologous recombination proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2, are associated with developmental abnormalities and tumorigenesis. Recent advances have provided a clearer understanding of the connections between these proteins and of the key steps of homologous recombination and DNA strand exchange.},

abstract = {Lysyl oxidase (LO) is a copper-dependent amine oxidase that plays a critical role in the biogenesis of connective tissue matrices by crosslinking the extracellular matrix proteins, collagen and elastin. Levels of LO increase in many fibrotic diseases, while expression of the enzyme is decreased in certain diseases involving impaired copper metabolism. While the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme is not yet available, many of its physical-chemical properties, its novel carbonyl cofactor, and its catalytic mechanism have been described. Lysyl oxidase is synthesized as a preproprotein, secreted as a 50 kDa, N-glycosylated proenzyme and then proteolytically cleaved to the 32 kDa, catalytically active, mature enzyme. Within the past decade, the gene encoding LO has been cloned, facilitating investigations of the regulation of expression of the enzyme in response to diverse stimuli and in numerous disease states. Transforming growth factor-beta, platelet-derived growth factor, angiotensin II, retinoic acid, fibroblast growth factor, altered serum conditions, and shear stress are among the effectors or conditions that regulate LO expression. New, LO-like genes have also been identified and cloned, suggesting the existence of a multigene family. It has also become increasingly evident that LO may have other important biological functions in addition to its role in the crosslinking of elastin and collagen in the extracellular matrix.},

abstract = {The in vitro oxidation of tryptophan (Trp) by pro-oxidant systems such as iron-ascorbate indicates that Trp is a target for oxygen radicals in vivo. The Trp in albumin and lipoproteins has been reported to be actively oxidized by hydroxyl radical (HO(*)) generating systems such as copper-ascorbate or PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) respectively. The super-physiological concentrations of the oxidants used in these studies prompted us to examine the effect of low copper and ascorbate concentrations on Trp oxidation. Trp (10-5000 mumol/L) was incubated with 1.5 mumol/L copper plus ascorbate (0.113 and 1.13 mmol/L) at 37 degrees C and its oxidation followed by fluorescence and high-performance liquid chromatography. The percentage of Trp oxidized by the ascorbate-copper system was inversely related to its concentration and positively related to the ascorbate concentration. High concentrations of Trp (above 50 mumol/L for 0.113 mmol/L and 500 mumol/L for 1.13 mmol/L ascorbate) are not significantly oxidized in the presence of ascorbate. The large drop in the percentage Trp oxidation at higher concentrations may be due to the chelation of copper by Trp. High concentrations of Trp (over 50 mumol/L) strongly prevented ascorbate oxidation by copper, and therefore inhibited the production of HO(*) needed for Trp oxidation. Protein Trp is less readily oxidized by the ascorbate-copper system than free Trp. Proteins chelate copper much better than Trp, and so inhibit its oxidative activity, at least against ascorbic acid.},

abstract = {One-day-old broiler chicks were adapted to a basal, isolated soyprotein-cornstarch diet containing 20% protein, 0.59% methionine and 3,300 kcal metabolizable energy (ME)/kg. They were then fed experimental diets consisting of three levels (0, 500, 1,000 ppm) of copper added to each of the basal diet plus four levels (0, 0.4, 0.8, or 1.5%) of L-methionine for 1 or 4 weeks. Growth was retarded after 1 week by all levels of supplementary methionine, and by 500 or 1,000 ppm excess copper. The plasma concentrations of free methionine, serine, alpha-aminobutyric acid and cystathionine were increased by excess dietary methionine. Excess copper prevented the increase in plasma methionine. After 4 weeks, the plasma methionine concentration and rate of growth of chicks fed 0.4% excess L-methionine did not differ significantly from basal values. The growth retardation caused by 500 ppm excess copper was alleviated by 0.4% supplemental methionine, and the elevations in plasma methionine and liver and spleen iron concentrations observed in chicks fed 1.5% excess methionine were reduced by 1,000 ppm excess copper. The patterns of the relationship between dietary methionine and liver or spleen iron, in the presence or absence of supplementary copper, were similar to those between dietary and free plasma methionine.},

abstract = {Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is activated by its natural ligand, mediating multiple essential biological processes. Copper (II) ions are bioactive ions and are crucial in the regulation of cell signaling pathway. However, the crosstalk between copper (II) ions and RTK-mediated cellular signaling remains unclear. Herein, we reported the effect of copper (II) ions on the ligand-independent RTK cellular signaling pathway. Our results indicate that both EGFR and MET signaling were activated by copper (II) in the absence of the corresponding ligands, EGF and HGF, respectively. Consequently, copper (II) ions initiate two RTK-mediated downstream signal transductions, including AKT and ERK. Moreover, copper (II) significantly increased proliferation and cellular migration. Our study proposes a novel role of copper in RTK-mediated signaling for growth factor-independent cancer cell proliferation and migration, implying that targeting both the copper (II) and growth factor in tumor microenvironments may be necessary for cancer treatment.},

abstract = {Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a multicopper oxidase with ferroxidase properties being of importance to the mobilisation and export of iron from cells and its ability to bind copper. In ageing humans, Cp deficiency is known to result in aceruloplasminemia, which among other is characterised by neurological symptoms. To obtain novel information about the functions of Cp in the central nervous system (CNS) we compared the brain proteome in forebrains from asymptomatic 4-6-month-old Cp-deficient (B6N(Cg)-Cp(tm1b(KOMP)Wtsi) /J) and wild-type mice. Of more than 5600 quantified proteins, 23 proteins, were regulated, whereas more than 1200 proteins had regulated post-translational modifications (PTMs). The genes of the regulated proteins, glycoproteins and phosphoproteins appeared mostly to be located to neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Cp deficiency especially affected the function of proteins involved in the extension of neuronal projections, synaptic signalling and cellular mRNA processing and affected the expression of proteins involved in neurodegenerative disease and diabetes. Iron concentration and transferrin saturation were reduced in the blood of even younger, 3- to 5-month-old, Cp-deficient mice. Iron act as cofactor in many enzymatic processes and reactions. Changes in iron availability and oxidation as consequence of Cp deficiency could therefore affect the synthesis of proteins and lipids. This proteomic characterisation is to our knowledge the first to document the changes taking place in the CNS-proteome and its phosphorylation and glycosylation state in Cp-deficient mice.},

abstract = {Catalytic quinone cofactors derived from posttranslational modification of amino acid residues within the enzyme polypeptide have roles in a variety of biological processes ranging from metabolism in bacteria to inflammation and connective tissue maturation in humans. In recent years, studies of the biosynthesis of one of these cofactors, tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ), have provided examples of novel chemistry that is required for the generation of these protein-derived cofactors. A novel c-type diheme enzyme, MauG, catalyzes a six-electron oxidation that completes TTQ biosynthesis in a 119-kDa protein substrate. The posttranslational modification reactions proceed via an unprecedented Fe(V) equivalent catalytic intermediate comprised of two hemes; one an Fe(IV)=O and the other a six-coordinate Fe(IV) with axial ligands provided by amino acid residues. This high valent diheme species is an alternative to Compound I, an Fe(IV)=O heme with a porphyrin or amino acid cation radical, which is typically the reactive intermediate of heme-dependent oxygenases and peroxidases.},

abstract = {Background: Collagen cross-linking is mediated by lysyl oxidase (LOX) enzyme in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of mitral valve leaflets. Alterations in collagen content and LOX protein expression in the ECM of degenerative mitral valve may enhance leaflet expansion and disease severity. Methods: Twenty posterior degenerative mitral valve leaflets from patients with severe mitral regurgitation were obtained at surgery. Five normal posterior mitral valve leaflets procured during autopsy served as controls. Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) density was quantified by immunohistochemistry, collagen types I and III by picro-sirius red staining and immunohistochemistry, and proteoglycans by alcian blue staining. Protein expression of LOX and its mediator TGF1 were quantified by immunofluorescence and gene expression by PCR. Results: VICs density was increased, structural type I collagen density was reduced, while reparative type III collagen and proteoglycan densities were increased (p<0.0001) with an increase in spongiosa layer thickness in myxomatous valves. These changes were associated with a reduction in LOX (p<0.0001) and increase in TGF1 protein expression (p<0.0001). However, no significant change was seen in gene expression. Linear regression analysis identified a correlation between type I collagen density and LOX grade (R2=0.855; p<0.0001). Conclusions: Reduced type I collagen density with a simultaneous increase in type III collagen and proteoglycan densities possibly contributes to spongiosa layer expansion resulting in incompetent mitral valve leaflets. Observed changes in type I and III collagen densities in DMVD may be secondary to alterations in LOX protein expression, contributing to disorganization of ECM and disease severity.},

abstract = {Changes in speciation of copper(II) in reactions with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and gallic acid (GA) as a function of pH have been investigated by multifrequency (X- and S-band) EPR spectroscopy in the fluid and frozen states. The EPR spectra show the formation of three distinct mononuclear species with each of the polyphenols, and these are interpreted in terms of one mono- and two bis-complexes. However, di- or polymeric complexes dominate the Cu(II) speciation in the pH range 48, and it is only at alkaline pH values that these mononuclear complexes make appreciable contributions to the metal speciation. Each mononuclear complex displays linewidth anisotropy in fluid solution as a consequence of incomplete averaging of the spin Hamiltonian parameters through molecular motion. Rotational correlation times for the individual complexes have been estimated by analysing the lineshape anisotropy of the fluid solution spectra using parameters determined by simulation of the rigid limit spectra. These show that the molecular masses increase with increasing pH, indicating either coordination of increasing numbers of polyphenol molecules as ligands to the copper or the increasing involvement of polyphenol dimers as ligands in the copper coordination sphere.},

abstract = {Speciation can provide knowledge about absorption, reactivity to binding sites, bioavailability, toxicity, and excretion of elements. In this study, the speciation of copper in different model solutions under the influence of gastrointestinal (GI) pH was studied by ion selective electrode (ISE) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). It was found that the electrode response (mV) against Cu2+ decreased with the increase in pH and dropped to the lowest point at pH 7.5 in all model solutions. When amino acids and organic acids were present, the ratio of filtered copper (0.45m, pH 7.5) was more than 90%. When casein was present, whey protein, pancreatin, and starch were added, and the ratio of filtered copper was 85.60.3, 56.78.8, 38.55.1, and 1.00.3%, respectively. When there is not enough organic ligand, excessive copper will form copper hydroxide precipitation with the increase in pH, but it got the highest electrode response (mV) against Cu2+. From this study, it can be concluded that the speciation of copper in GI tract is strongly influenced by the pH and the composition of food. When there are few ligands coexisting in the GI tract, the concentration of copper ion may be relatively high.},

abstract = {Copper is an essential trace metal element that significantly affects human physiology and pathology by regulating various important biological processes, including mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, iron mobilization, connective tissue crosslinking, antioxidant defense, melanin synthesis, blood clotting, and neuron peptide maturation. Increasing lines of evidence obtained from studies of cell culture, animals, and human genetics have demonstrated that dysregulation of copper metabolism causes heart disease, which is the leading cause of mortality in the US. Defects of copper homeostasis caused by perturbed regulation of copper chaperones or copper transporters or by copper deficiency resulted in various types of heart disease, including cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus cardiomyopathy. This review aims to provide a timely summary of the effects of defective copper homeostasis on heart disease and discuss potential underlying molecular mechanisms.},

abstract = {Background: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a life-threatening heart disease and a common cause of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and subsequent left or biventricular dilatation. A significant number of cases have a genetic etiology; however, as a complex disease, the exact genetic risk factors are largely unknown, and many patients remain without a molecular diagnosis. Methods: We performed GWAS followed by whole-genome, transcriptome, and immunohistochemical analyses in a spontaneously occurring canine model of DCM. Canine gene discovery was followed up in three human DCM cohorts. Results: Our results revealed two independent additive loci associated with the typical DCM phenotype comprising left ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilatation. We highlight two novel candidate genes, RNF207 and PRKAA2, known for their involvement in cardiac action potentials, energy homeostasis, and morphology. We further illustrate the distinct genetic etiologies underlying the typical DCM phenotype and ventricular premature contractions. Finally, we followed up on the canine discoveries in human DCM patients and discovered candidate variants in our two novel genes. Conclusions: Collectively, our study yields insight into the molecular pathophysiology of DCM and provides a large animal model for preclinical studies. Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13073-023-01221-3.},

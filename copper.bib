abstract = {<jats:p>Senile plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer disease (AD) are primarily composed of the amyloidupbeta (Aupbeta) peptide and contain substantially elevated levels of iron, copper and zinc. These metals bind to Aupbeta and have been reported to increase the toxicity of Aupbeta to cultured neurones. Other reports have demonstrated that Aupbeta can reduce the neurotoxicity of metal ions, suggesting that the interaction can, under some circumstances, be protective. To investigate these apparently conflicting results, human Aupbetai42 was coinjected with iron, copper or zinc (at the concentrations found in plaques) into rat cerebral cortex, and the resulting numbers of dying neurones were compared. It was found that Aupbeta complexed with either iron or zinc was more toxic than Aupbeta alone. In contrast, Aupbetacopper complexes were not neurotoxic. Surprisingly, we observed that when iron or copper were combined with Aupbeta, the neurotoxicity of these metals was substantially reduced, suggesting that Aupbeta may help to limit the toxicity of redoxactive metal ions, thereby assisting the antioxidant defence of the brain. Thus paradoxical effects occur when AP complexes with metal ions, where Aupbetametal complexes are capable of being neurotoxic and neuroprotective.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are prevalent and currently incurable conditions that progressively impair cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric functions of the central or peripheral nervous system. Fibrinogen, a macromolecular glycoprotein, plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response and tissue repair in the human body and interacts with various nervous system cells due to its unique molecular structure. Accumulating evidence suggests that fibrinogen deposits in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. By regulating pathophysiological mechanisms and signaling pathways, fibrinogen can exacerbate the neuro-pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases, while depletion of fibrinogen contributes to the amelioration of cognitive function impairment in patients. This review comprehensively summarizes the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of fibrinogen in central nervous system cells and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Vascular dementia, Huntington's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Additionally, we discuss the potential of fibrinogen-related treatments in the management of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A recent study by Rackaityte et al. reported evidence for a low level of bacterial colonization, specifically of <jats:italic>Micrococcus luteus</jats:italic>, in the intestine of second trimester human fetuses. We have re-analyzed their sequence data and identified a batch effect which violates the underlying assumptions of the bioinformatic method used for contamination removal. This batch effect resulted in <jats:italic>Micrococcus</jats:italic> not being identified as a contaminant in the original work and being falsely assigned to the fetal samples. We further provide evidence that the micrographs presented by Rackaityte et al. are unlikely to show Micrococci or other bacteria as the size of the particles shown exceeds that of related bacterial cells. Finally, phylogenetic analysis showed that the microbes cultured from the fetal samples differed significantly from those detected by sequencing. Overall, our findings show that the presence of <jats:italic>Micrococcus</jats:italic> in the fetal gut is not supported by the primary sequence data. Our findings underline important aspects of the nature of contamination for both sequencing and culture approaches in microbiome studies and the appropriate use of automated contamination identification tools.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a member of the APP family of proteins, and different enzymatic processing leads to the production of several derivatives that are shown to have distinct biological functions. APP is involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder causing dementia. Furthermore, it is believed that individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have increased APP expression, due to an extra copy of chromosome 21 (Hsa21), that contains the gene for APP. Nevertheless, the physiological function of APP remains unclear. It is known that APP plays an important role in neural growth and maturation during brain development, possibly by influencing proliferation, cell fate specification and neurogenesis of neural stem cells (NSCs). Proteolytic cleavage of APP occurs mainly via two mutually exclusive pathways, the non-amyloidogenic pathway or the amyloidogenic pathway. Other alternative pathways ($\eta$-secretase, $\delta$-secretase and meprin pathways) have also been described for the physiological processing of APP. The different metabolites generated from these pathways, including soluble APP$\alpha$ (sAPP$\alpha$), soluble APP$\beta$ (sAPP$\beta$), $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) peptides and the APP intracellular domain (AICD), have different functions determined by their structural differences, equilibrium and concentration with respect to other fragments derived from APP. This review discusses recent observations regarding possible functions of APP and its proteolytic derivatives in the biology and phenotypic specification of NSCs. This can be important for a better understanding of the pathogenesis and the development of future therapeutic applications for AD and/or DS, diseases in which alterations in neurogenesis have been described.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been widely studied due to its association with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the physiological functions of APP are still largely unexplored. APP is a transmembrane glycoprotein whose expression in humans is abundant in the central nervous system. Specifically, several studies have revealed the high expression of APP during brain development. Previous studies in our laboratory revealed that a transient increase in APP expression induces early cell cycle exit of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and directs their differentiation towards glial cells (gliogenesis) while decreasing their differentiation towards neurons (neurogenesis). In the present study, we have evaluated the intrinsic cellular effects of APP down-expression (using siRNA) on cell death, cell proliferation, and cell fate specification of hNSCs. Our data indicate that APP silencing causes cellular effects opposite to those obtained in previous APP overexpression assays, inducing cell proliferation in hNS1 cells (a model line of hNSCs) and favoring neurogenesis instead of gliogenesis in these cells. In addition, we have analyzed the gene and protein expression levels of upbeta-Catenin as a possible molecule involved in these cellular effects. These data could help to understand the biological role of APP, which is necessary to deepen the knowledge of AD.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Neurogenesis in the developing human cerebral cortex occurs at a particularly slow rate owing in part to cortical neural progenitors preserving their progenitor state for a relatively long time, while generating neurons. How this balance between the progenitor and neurogenic state is regulated, and whether it contributes to species-specific brain temporal patterning, is poorly understood. Here, we show that the characteristic potential of human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to remain in a progenitor state as they generate neurons for a prolonged amount of time requires the amyloid precursor protein (APP). In contrast, APP is dispensable in mouse NPCs, which undergo neurogenesis at a much faster rate. Mechanistically, APP cell-autonomously contributes to protracted neurogenesis through suppression of the proneurogenic activator protein-1 transcription factor and facilitation of canonical WNT signaling. We propose that the fine balance between self-renewal and differentiation is homeostatically regulated by APP, which may contribute to human-specific temporal patterns of neurogenesis.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The physiological actions of orally ingested peptides on the brain remain poorly understood. This study examined the effects of 39 orally administered synthetic Tyr-containing dipeptides on the enhancement of brain norepinephrine metabolism in mice by comparing the concentration of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG). Although Tyr-Tyr administration increased blood and cerebral cortex (Cx) Tyr concentrations the most, Tyr-Trp increased Cx MHPG concentration the most. The oral administration of Tyr-Trp ameliorated a short-term memory deficit of a mouse model of cognitive dysfunction induced by amyloid beta peptide 25-35. Gene expression profiling of mouse brain using a microarray indicated that Tyr-Trp administration led to a wide variety of changes in mRNA levels, including the upregulation of genes encoding molecules involved in catecholamine metabolism. A comparative metabolome analysis of the Cx of mice given Tyr-Trp or Tyr-Tyr demonstrated that Tyr-Trp administration yielded higher concentrations of Trp and kynurenine pathway metabolites than Tyr-Tyr administration, as well as higher L-dopa levels, which is the initial product of catecholamine metabolism. Catecholamines were not significantly increased in the Cx of the Tyr-Tyr group compared with the Tyr-Trp group, despite a marked increase in Tyr. Presumably, Tyr-Trp administration enhances catecholamine synthesis and metabolism via the upregulation of genes involved in Tyr and Trp metabolism as well as metabolites of Tyr and Trp. These findings strongly suggest that orally ingested Tyr-Trp modulates the brain metabolome involved in catecholamine metabolism and contributes to higher brain function.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Besides its role in coagulation, vitamin K seems to be involved in various other mechanisms, including inflammation and age-related diseases, also at the level of gene expression. This work examined the roles of two vitamin K2 (menaquinones) vitamers, namely, menaquinone-4 (MK4) and reduced menaquinone-7 (MK7R), as gene modulator compounds, as well as their potential role in the epigenetic regulation of genes involved in amyloidogenesis and neuroinflammation. The SK-N-BE human neuroblastoma cells provided a Ux201c[bad char  vv=8220]first-lineUx201d[bad char  vv=8221] model for screening the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative molecular pathways. MK7R, being a new vitamin K form, was first tested in terms of solubilization, uptake and cell viability, together with MK4 as an endogenous control. We assessed the expression of key factors in amyloidogenesis and neuroinflammation, observing that the MK7R treatment was associated with the downregulation of neurodegeneration- (PSEN1 and BACE1) and neuroinflammation- (IL-1upbeta and IL-6) associated genes, whereas genes retaining protective roles toward amiloidogenesis were upregulated (ADAM10 and ADAM17). By profiling the DNA methylation patterns of genes known to be epigenetically regulated, we observed a correlation between hypermethylation and the downregulation of PSEN1, IL-1upbeta and IL-6. These results suggest a possible role of MK7R in the treatment of cognitive impairment, giving a possible base for further preclinical experiments in animal models of neurodegenerative disease.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title> <jats:p>In mammals, copper (Cu) absorption occurs mostly in the small intestine, and some of the Cu transporters involved in its uptake have been characterised. In fish, however, the regions of the gut involved in Cu absorption and the membrane transport mechanisms responsible for gastrointestinal Cu uptake are unknown. Everted gut sacs and isolated perfused intestine of Clarias gariepinus were used to explore Cu absorption (at 22 \textdegreeC). Gut sacs exposed to 100 upmumol lminus1mucosal solution Cu ([Cu]m) showed that Cu was mostly (70 %) absorbed in the middle and hind intestine. Most of the accumulated Cu was located in the mucosa. In perfused intestines, cumulative Cu absorption from the mucosal solution to the serosal perfusate was greatest at 10 upmumol lminus1[Cu]m and decreased at higher values of [Cu]m, while tissue accumulation of Cu showed a dose-dependent elevation. Absorption efficiency therefore declined with increasing Cu dose, and basolateral transport was the limiting factor in Cu uptake. Serosal applications of the P-type ATPase inhibitor vanadate (100 upmumol lminus1) or the anion transport inhibitor DIDS (100 upmumol lminus1) caused threefold increases in net Cu uptake (at [Cu]m=10 upmumol lminus1). The vanadate effect was explained by a reduction in transepithelial potential rather than inhibition of Cu-ATPase, but the DIDS effect was not. Transepithelial potential, water transport and tissue [Cu] were not affected by DIDS, but tissue [K+] was elevated. Removal of Clminussimultaneously from both the mucosal and serosal solutions caused a 10-fold reduction in the rate of Cu uptake, while removal of Clminusfrom the mucosal solution only completely abolished Cu absorption to the serosal perfusate. Transepithelial potential effects are discussed. We conclude that Cu absorption occurs mostly in the intestine and is normally driven by a basolateral Cu/anion symport that prefers Clminus.</jats:p>},

description = {The article looks at the basic mechanisms of anemia in patients with liver cirrhosis (bleeding through esophageal varices, hemorrhoids, vascular fragility, hypertensive portal gastropathy, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, vitamin K deficiency, splenic rupture, splenic sequestration of red blood cells in splenomegaly) and also the additional mechanisms of anemia in liver cirrhosis (erythropoietin deficiency, renal injury, chronic inflammation, deficiency of trace elements and vitamins, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, Zieve syndrome). Depending on the Child-Pugh staging of liver cirrhosis, as well as the associated pathologies of the patient with liver cirrhosis, it is possible that there are simultaneously several ways of the appearance of anemia. It is an attempt to achieve more than a simple review of them in a tabular form, focusing not only on physiopathology, but also on diagnostic and therapeutic elements - the latter being briefly mentioned in widely known situations and presented in more detail in the context of the rarer causes of anemia in patients with liver cirrhosis. In conclusion, the differential and positive diagnosis of anemia in liver cirrhosis decisively influences the therapeutic decision and, of course, not only survival, but also the patient's quality of life. Interdisciplinary collaboration (family doctor, gastroenterologist, internist, infectious disease specialist, hematologist, surgeon, ICA, medical imaging, laboratory) is the optimal way to a diagnosis and targeted treatment of the causes of anemia in liver cirrhosis.},

abstract = {Copper (Cu) in its ionic forms is an essential element for mammals and its homeostasis is tightly controlled. Accordingly{,} Cu-dyshomeostasis can be lethal as is the case in the well-established genetic Wilson{'}s and Menkes diseases. In Alzheimer{'}s disease (AD){,} Cu-accumulation occurs in amyloid plaques{,} where it is bound to the amyloid-beta peptide (Aupbeta). In vitro{,} Cu-Aupbeta is competent to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of ascorbate under aerobic conditions{,} and hence Cu-Aupbeta is believed to contribute to the oxidative stress in AD. Several molecules that can recover extracellular Cu from Aupbeta and transport it back into cells with beneficial effects in cell culture and transgenic AD models were identified. However{,} all the Cu-shuttles currently available are not satisfactory due to various potential limitations including ion selectivity and toxicity. Hence{,} we designed a novel peptide-based Cu shuttle with the following properties: (i) it contains a Cu(ii)-binding motif that is very selective to Cu(ii) over all other essential metal ions; (ii) it is tagged with a fluorophore sensitive to Cu(ii)-binding and release; (iii) it is made of a peptide platform{,} which is very versatile to add new functions. The work presented here reports on the characterization of AKH-upalphaR5W4NBD{,} which is able to transport Cu ions selectively into PC12 cells and the imported Cu appeared bioavailable{,} likely via reductive release induced by glutathione.

abstract_as_rcvd = {Copper (Cu) in its ionic forms is an essential element for mammals and its homeostasis is tightly controlled. Accordingly{,} Cu-dyshomeostasis can be lethal as is the case in the well-established genetic Wilson{'}s and Menkes diseases. In Alzheimer{'}s disease (AD){,} Cu-accumulation occurs in amyloid plaques{,} where it is bound to the amyloid-beta peptide (AŒ≤). In vitro{,} CuÄìAŒ≤ is competent to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of ascorbate under aerobic conditions{,} and hence CuÄìAŒ≤ is believed to contribute to the oxidative stress in AD. Several molecules that can recover extracellular Cu from AŒ≤ and transport it back into cells with beneficial effects in cell culture and transgenic AD models were identified. However{,} all the Cu-shuttles currently available are not satisfactory due to various potential limitations including ion selectivity and toxicity. Hence{,} we designed a novel peptide-based Cu shuttle with the following properties: (i) it contains a Cu(ii)-binding motif that is very selective to Cu(ii) over all other essential metal ions; (ii) it is tagged with a fluorophore sensitive to Cu(ii)-binding and release; (iii) it is made of a peptide platform{,} which is very versatile to add new functions. The work presented here reports on the characterization of AKH-ŒR5W4NBD{,} which is able to transport Cu ions selectively into PC12 cells and the imported Cu appeared bioavailable{,} likely via reductive release induced by glutathione. Moreover{,} AKH-ŒR5W4NBD was able to withdraw Cu from the AŒ≤1Äì16 peptide and consequently inhibited the Cu-AŒ≤ based reactive oxygen species production and related cell toxicity. Hence{,} AKH-ŒR5W4NBD could be a valuable new tool for Cu-transport into cells and suitable for mechanistic studies in cell culture{,} with potential applications in restoring Cu-homeostasis in Cu-related diseases such as AD.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>The classical deficiency diseases have nearly disappeared from the industrialised world and are thought to be found largely in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. More than 80 collected medical articles, mostly from Europe and North America, describe more than 9000 people with low concentrations of copper in organs or tissues or impaired metabolic pathways dependent on copper. More than a dozen articles reveal improved anatomy, chemistry or physiology in more than 1000 patients from supplements containing copper. These criteria are diagnostic of deficiency according to The Oxford Textbook of Medicine. Alzheimer's disease, ischaemic heart disease and osteoporosis receive major emphasis here. However, impaired vision, myelodysplastic syndrome and peripheral neuropathy are mentioned. Copper deficiency probably causes some common, contemporaneous diseases. Advice is provided about opportunities for research. Seemingly authoritative statements concerning the rarity of nutritional deficiency in developed countries are wrong.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and its homologues are transmembrane proteins required for various aspects of neuronal development and activity, whose molecular function is unknown. Specifically, it is unclear whether APP acts as a receptor, and if so what its ligand(s) may be. We show that APP binds the Wnt ligands Wnt3a and Wnt5a and that this binding regulates APP protein levels. Wnt3a binding promotes full-length APP (flAPP) recycling and stability. In contrast, Wnt5a promotes APP targeting to lysosomal compartments and reduces flAPP levels. A conserved Cysteine-Rich Domain (CRD) in the extracellular portion of APP is required for Wnt binding, and deletion of the CRD abrogates the effects of Wnts on flAPP levels and trafficking. Finally, loss of APP results in increased axonal and reduced dendritic growth of mouse embryonic primary cortical neurons. This phenotype can be cell-autonomously rescued by full length, but not CRD-deleted, APP and regulated by Wnt ligands in a CRD-dependent manner.},

The results indicated that exposure to 6 mg/l Cu for 72 h induced the production of reactive oxygen species, thereby increasing protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation in enterocytes of grass carp <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>. Cells exposed to Cu alone resulted in a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase release, which is accompanied by depletions of antioxidants, including total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), anti-superoxide anion (ASA), anti-hydroxy radical (AHR) activities and GSH content. Pre-treatment with Glu remarkably prevented the toxic effects of Cu on the T-SOD, GST, GR, AHR, and ASA activities and GSH content in enterocytes. However, Cu induced an adaptive increase in the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Glu supplementation further increased GPx activity in enterocytes. Interestingly, the experiment <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> showed that Glu pre-supplementation significantly elevated SOD, GPx, GST, GR, ASA and AHR activities, as well as GSH content. Further results showed that pre-treatment with Glu could alleviate Cu-induced oxidative injury by elevating antioxidant enzyme activities through regulating the expression of NF-E2-related nuclear factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA. Together, these results indicated that Glu could attenuate Cu-induced cellular oxidative damage in fish intestine, likely mediated through Nrf2 signalling pathways regulating mRNA expressions of antioxidant enzyme genes and synthesis of GSH.</jats:p>},

We herein describe in detail a case series of liver disease patients (n\NBSP=\NBSP12) who presented with signs of copper deficiency based on serum and liver copper measurements. Median age of the group at the time of presentation was 39 (range 1864 years). Six patients were female. The median serum copper was 46 upmug/dL (normal range: 80155 upmug/dL for women and 70140 upmug/dL for men). Seven of the 12 patients had hepatic copper concentration less than 10 upmug/g dry weight (normal range: 1035 upmug/g).

abstract = {<jats:p>Ceruloplasmin is a ferroxidase that plays a role in iron homeostasis; its deficiency fosters inter alia iron accumulation in the liver, which expresses the soluble form of the protein secreted into the bloodstream. Ceruloplasmin is also secreted by the adipose tissue, but its role in adipocytes has been poorly investigated. We hypothesized that ceruloplasmin might have a role in iron/lipid interplay. We investigated iron/lipid dysmetabolism in the liver and adipose tissue of the ceruloplasmin-deficient mouse (CpKO) model of aceruloplasminemia and evaluated the effectiveness of ceruloplasmin replacement. We found that CpKO mice were overweight, showing adipose tissue accumulation, liver iron deposition and steatosis. In the adipose tissue of CpKO mice, iron homeostasis was not altered. Conversely, the levels of adiponectin and leptin adipokines behaved opposite to the wild-type. Increased macrophage infiltration was observed in adipose tissue and liver of CpKO mice, indicating tissue inflammation. The treatment of CpKO mice with ceruloplasmin limited liver iron accumulation and steatosis without normalizing the expression of iron homeostasis-related proteins. In the CpKO mice, the protein replacement limited macrophage infiltration in both adipose and hepatic tissues reduced the level of serum triglycerides, and partially recovered adipokines levels in the adipose tissue. These results underline the link between iron and lipid dysmetabolism in ceruloplasmin-deficient mice, suggesting that ceruloplasmin in adipose tissue has an anti-inflammatory role rather than a role in iron homeostasis. Furthermore, these data also indicate that ceruloplasmin replacement therapy may be effective at a systemic level.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid; AA) and copper (Cu2+) are well used supplements with many health-promoting actions. However, when they are used in combination, the Fenton reaction occurs, leading to the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. Given that kidney is vulnerable to many toxicants including free radicals, we speculated that the in vivo administration of AA plus Cu2+ may cause oxidative kidney injury. The purpose of this study was to address this possibility. Mice were administered with AA and Cu2+, alone or in combination, via oral gavage once a day for various periods. Changes in the systemic oxidative status, as well renal structure and functions, were examined. The administration of AA plus Cu2+ elevated protein oxidation in serum, intestine, bladder, and kidney, as evidenced by the increased sulfenic acid formation and decreased level of free sulfhydryl groups (-SH). The systemic oxidative stress induced by AA plus Cu2+ was associated with a significant loss of renal function and structure, as indicated by the increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and urinary proteins, as well as glomerular and tubular cell injury. These effects of AA and Cu2+ were only observed when used in combination, and could be entirely prevented by thiol antioxidant NAC. Further analysis using cultured renal tubular epithelial cells revealed that AA plus Cu2+ caused cellular protein oxidation and cell death, which could be abolished by NAC and catalase. Moreover, coincubation of AA and Cu2+ led to H2O2 production. Collectively, our study revealed that a combined administration of AA and Cu2+ resulted in systemic oxidative stress and renal cell injury. As health-promoting supplements, AA and Cu2+ should not be used together.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The hepatic content of amyloid beta (Abeta) decreases drastically in human and rodent cirrhosis highlighting the importance of understanding the consequences of Abeta deficiency in the liver. This is especially relevant in view of recent advances in anti-Abeta therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, it is shown that partial hepatic loss of Abeta in transgenic AD mice immunized with Abeta antibody 3D6 and its absence in amyloid precursor protein (APP) knockout mice (APP-KO), as well as in human liver spheroids with APP knockdown upregulates classical hallmarks of fibrosis, smooth muscle alpha-actin, and collagen type I. Abeta absence in APP-KO and deficiency in immunized mice lead to strong activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta), alpha secretases, NOTCH pathway, inflammation, decreased permeability of liver sinusoids, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Inversely, increased systemic and intrahepatic levels of Abeta42 in transgenic AD mice and neprilysin inhibitor LBQ657-treated wild-type mice protect the liver against carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4) )-induced injury. Transcriptomic analysis of CCl(4) -treated transgenic AD mouse livers uncovers the regulatory effects of Abeta42 on mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, and its onco-suppressive effects accompanied by reduced synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. Combined, these data reveal Abeta as an indispensable regulator of cell-cell interactions in healthy liver and a powerful protector against liver fibrosis.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically by cognitive decline and pathologically by the accumulation of amyloid--containing senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. A great deal of attention has focused on amyloid- as the major pathogenic mechanisms with the ultimate goal of using amyloid- lowering therapies as an avenue of treatment. Unfortunately, nearly a quarter century later, no tangible progress has been offered, whereas spectacular failure tends to be the most compelling. We have long contended, as has substantial literature, that proteinaceous accumulations are simply downstream and, often, endstage manifestations of disease. Their overall poor correlation with the level of dementia, and their presence in the cognitively intact is evidence that is often ignored as an inconvenient truth. Current research examining amyloid oligomers, therefore, will add copious details to what is, in essence, a reductionist distraction from upstream pleiotrophic processes such as oxidative stress, cell cycle dysfunction, and inflammation. It is now long overdue that the neuroscientists avoid the pitfall of perseverating on proteinopathies and recognize that the continued targeting of end stage lesions in the face of repeated failure, or worse, is a losing proposition.},

abstract = {Age is a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke. However, the influence of aging on coagulation parameters in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) remains unclear. A total of 775 samples were collected from 224 NVAF patients receiving apixaban, edoxaban or rivaroxaban. The samples were categorized into three age groups: (i) </= 64 years, (ii) 65-74 years, and (iii) >/= 75 years (apixaban: N = 48, 108, 119; edoxaban: N = 63, 68, 126; rivaroxaban: N = 115, 90, 38, respectively). Coagulation parameters including fibrinogen (Fbg), factor II, factor V, factor VII, factor X, and D-dimer, were compared between the three age groups for each drug. The slopes in the correlation between drug concentrations and modified diluted prothrombin time (mdPT) were also assessed. Fbg and factor V increased with age, while factor II and factor X decreased. Factor VII and D-dimer showed no significant differences across age categories. The slope in response to drug concentrations was similar between the age groups. In NVAF patients treated with apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, some coagulation parameters exhibited age-related variation. However, the response of mdPT to drug concentration was consistent across age categories.},

abstract = {Fibrinogen is an abundant protein synthesized in the liver, present in human blood plasma at concentrations ranging from 1.5-4 g/L in healthy individuals with a normal half-life of 3-5 days. With fibrin, produced by thrombin-mediated cleavage, fibrinogen plays important roles in many physiological processes. Indeed, the formation of a stable blood clot, containing polymerized and cross-linked fibrin, is crucial to prevent blood loss and drive wound healing upon vascular injury. A balance between clotting, notably the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, and fibrinolysis, the proteolytic degradation of the fibrin mesh, is essential. Disruption of this equilibrium can cause disease in distinct manners. While some pathological conditions are the consequence of altered levels of fibrinogen, others are related to structural properties of the molecule. The source of fibrinogen expression and the localization of fibrin(ogen) protein also have clinical implications. Low levels of fibrinogen expression have been detected in extra-hepatic tissues, including carcinomas, potentially contributing to disease. Fibrin(ogen) deposits at aberrant sites including the central nervous system or kidney, can also be pathological. In this review, we discuss disorders in which fibrinogen and fibrin are implicated, highlighting mechanisms that may contribute to disease.},

abstract = {Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors are commonly divided into prohemorrhagic (FII, FVII, FIX, and FX) and antithrombotic (protein C and protein S). Furthermore, another protein (protein Z) does not seem strictly correlated with blood clotting. As a consequence of this assumption, vitamin K-dependent defects were considered as hemorrhagic or thrombotic disorders. Recent clinical observations, and especially, recent advances in molecular biology investigations, have demonstrated that this was incorrect. In 2009, it was demonstrated that the mutation Arg338Leu in exon 8 of FIX was associated with the appearance of a thrombophilic state and venous thrombosis. The defect was characterized by a 10-fold increased activity in FIX activity, while FIX antigen was only slightly increased (FIX Padua). On the other hand, it was noted on clinical grounds that the thrombosis, mainly venous, was present in about 2% to 3% of patients with FVII deficiency. It was subsequently demonstrated that 2 mutations in FVII, namely, Arg304Gln and Ala294Val, were particularly affected. Both these mutations are type 2 defects, namely, they show low activity but normal or near-normal FVII antigen. More recently, in 2011-2012, it was noted that prothrombin defects due to mutations of Arg596 to Leu, Gln, or Trp in exon 15 cause the appearance of a dysprothrombinemia that shows no bleeding tendency but instead a prothrombotic state with venous thrombosis. On the contrary, no abnormality of protein C or protein S has been shown to be associated with bleeding rather than with thrombosis. These studies have considerably widened the spectrum and significance of blood coagulation studies.},

abstract = {Reduced sulfatide level is found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Here, we demonstrate that amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing regulates sulfatide synthesis and vice versa. Different cell culture models and transgenic mice models devoid of APP processing or in particular the APP intracellular domain (AICD) reveal that AICD decreases Gal3st1/CST expression and subsequently sulfatide synthesis. In return, sulfatide supplementation decreases Abeta generation by reducing beta-secretase (BACE1) and gamma-secretase processing of APP. Increased BACE1 lysosomal degradation leads to reduced BACE1 protein level in endosomes. Reduced gamma-secretase activity is caused by a direct effect on gamma-secretase activity and reduced amounts of gamma-secretase components in lipid rafts. Similar changes were observed by analyzing cells and mice brain samples deficient of arylsulfatase A responsible for sulfatide degradation or knocked down in Gal3st1/CST. In line with these findings, addition of sulfatides to brain homogenates of AD patients resulted in reduced gamma-secretase activity. Human brain APP level shows a significant negative correlation with GAL3ST1/CST expression underlining the in vivo relevance of sulfatide homeostasis in AD.},

abstract = {Our group and others have reported a series of studies showing that heavy burdens of diarrheal diseases in the formative first two years of life in children in urban shantytowns have profound consequences of impaired physical and cognitive development lasting into later childhood and schooling. Based on these previous studies showing that apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is relatively common in favela children, we review recent data suggesting a protective role for the APOE4 allele in the cognitive and physical development of children with heavy burdens of diarrhea in early childhood. Despite being a marker for cognitive decline with Alzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases later in life, APOE4 appears to be important for cognitive development under the stress of heavy diarrhea. The reviewed findings provide a potential explanation for the survival advantage in evolution of the thrifty APOE4 allele and raise questions about its implications for human development under life-style changes and environmental challenges.},

abstract = {Mitotic homologous recombination promotes genome stability through the precise repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other lesions that are encountered during normal cellular metabolism and from exogenous insults. As a result, homologous recombination repair is essential during proliferative stages in development and during somatic cell renewal in adults to protect against cell death and mutagenic outcomes from DNA damage. Mutations in mammalian genes encoding homologous recombination proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2, are associated with developmental abnormalities and tumorigenesis. Recent advances have provided a clearer understanding of the connections between these proteins and of the key steps of homologous recombination and DNA strand exchange.},

abstract = {Lysyl oxidase (LO) is a copper-dependent amine oxidase that plays a critical role in the biogenesis of connective tissue matrices by crosslinking the extracellular matrix proteins, collagen and elastin. Levels of LO increase in many fibrotic diseases, while expression of the enzyme is decreased in certain diseases involving impaired copper metabolism. While the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme is not yet available, many of its physical-chemical properties, its novel carbonyl cofactor, and its catalytic mechanism have been described. Lysyl oxidase is synthesized as a preproprotein, secreted as a 50 kDa, N-glycosylated proenzyme and then proteolytically cleaved to the 32 kDa, catalytically active, mature enzyme. Within the past decade, the gene encoding LO has been cloned, facilitating investigations of the regulation of expression of the enzyme in response to diverse stimuli and in numerous disease states. Transforming growth factor-beta, platelet-derived growth factor, angiotensin II, retinoic acid, fibroblast growth factor, altered serum conditions, and shear stress are among the effectors or conditions that regulate LO expression. New, LO-like genes have also been identified and cloned, suggesting the existence of a multigene family. It has also become increasingly evident that LO may have other important biological functions in addition to its role in the crosslinking of elastin and collagen in the extracellular matrix.},

abstract = {The in vitro oxidation of tryptophan (Trp) by pro-oxidant systems such as iron-ascorbate indicates that Trp is a target for oxygen radicals in vivo. The Trp in albumin and lipoproteins has been reported to be actively oxidized by hydroxyl radical (HO(*)) generating systems such as copper-ascorbate or PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) respectively. The super-physiological concentrations of the oxidants used in these studies prompted us to examine the effect of low copper and ascorbate concentrations on Trp oxidation. Trp (10-5000 mumol/L) was incubated with 1.5 mumol/L copper plus ascorbate (0.113 and 1.13 mmol/L) at 37 degrees C and its oxidation followed by fluorescence and high-performance liquid chromatography. The percentage of Trp oxidized by the ascorbate-copper system was inversely related to its concentration and positively related to the ascorbate concentration. High concentrations of Trp (above 50 mumol/L for 0.113 mmol/L and 500 mumol/L for 1.13 mmol/L ascorbate) are not significantly oxidized in the presence of ascorbate. The large drop in the percentage Trp oxidation at higher concentrations may be due to the chelation of copper by Trp. High concentrations of Trp (over 50 mumol/L) strongly prevented ascorbate oxidation by copper, and therefore inhibited the production of HO(*) needed for Trp oxidation. Protein Trp is less readily oxidized by the ascorbate-copper system than free Trp. Proteins chelate copper much better than Trp, and so inhibit its oxidative activity, at least against ascorbic acid.},

abstract = {One-day-old broiler chicks were adapted to a basal, isolated soyprotein-cornstarch diet containing 20% protein, 0.59% methionine and 3,300 kcal metabolizable energy (ME)/kg. They were then fed experimental diets consisting of three levels (0, 500, 1,000 ppm) of copper added to each of the basal diet plus four levels (0, 0.4, 0.8, or 1.5%) of L-methionine for 1 or 4 weeks. Growth was retarded after 1 week by all levels of supplementary methionine, and by 500 or 1,000 ppm excess copper. The plasma concentrations of free methionine, serine, alpha-aminobutyric acid and cystathionine were increased by excess dietary methionine. Excess copper prevented the increase in plasma methionine. After 4 weeks, the plasma methionine concentration and rate of growth of chicks fed 0.4% excess L-methionine did not differ significantly from basal values. The growth retardation caused by 500 ppm excess copper was alleviated by 0.4% supplemental methionine, and the elevations in plasma methionine and liver and spleen iron concentrations observed in chicks fed 1.5% excess methionine were reduced by 1,000 ppm excess copper. The patterns of the relationship between dietary methionine and liver or spleen iron, in the presence or absence of supplementary copper, were similar to those between dietary and free plasma methionine.},

abstract = {Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is activated by its natural ligand, mediating multiple essential biological processes. Copper (II) ions are bioactive ions and are crucial in the regulation of cell signaling pathway. However, the crosstalk between copper (II) ions and RTK-mediated cellular signaling remains unclear. Herein, we reported the effect of copper (II) ions on the ligand-independent RTK cellular signaling pathway. Our results indicate that both EGFR and MET signaling were activated by copper (II) in the absence of the corresponding ligands, EGF and HGF, respectively. Consequently, copper (II) ions initiate two RTK-mediated downstream signal transductions, including AKT and ERK. Moreover, copper (II) significantly increased proliferation and cellular migration. Our study proposes a novel role of copper in RTK-mediated signaling for growth factor-independent cancer cell proliferation and migration, implying that targeting both the copper (II) and growth factor in tumor microenvironments may be necessary for cancer treatment.},

abstract = {Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a multicopper oxidase with ferroxidase properties being of importance to the mobilisation and export of iron from cells and its ability to bind copper. In ageing humans, Cp deficiency is known to result in aceruloplasminemia, which among other is characterised by neurological symptoms. To obtain novel information about the functions of Cp in the central nervous system (CNS) we compared the brain proteome in forebrains from asymptomatic 4-6-month-old Cp-deficient (B6N(Cg)-Cp(tm1b(KOMP)Wtsi) /J) and wild-type mice. Of more than 5600 quantified proteins, 23 proteins, were regulated, whereas more than 1200 proteins had regulated post-translational modifications (PTMs). The genes of the regulated proteins, glycoproteins and phosphoproteins appeared mostly to be located to neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Cp deficiency especially affected the function of proteins involved in the extension of neuronal projections, synaptic signalling and cellular mRNA processing and affected the expression of proteins involved in neurodegenerative disease and diabetes. Iron concentration and transferrin saturation were reduced in the blood of even younger, 3- to 5-month-old, Cp-deficient mice. Iron act as cofactor in many enzymatic processes and reactions. Changes in iron availability and oxidation as consequence of Cp deficiency could therefore affect the synthesis of proteins and lipids. This proteomic characterisation is to our knowledge the first to document the changes taking place in the CNS-proteome and its phosphorylation and glycosylation state in Cp-deficient mice.},

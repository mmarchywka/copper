abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>There is a growing level of interest in the potential role inflammation has on the initiation and progression of malignancy. Notable examples include <jats:italic>Helicobacter pylori</jats:italic>-mediated inflammation in gastric cancer and more recently <jats:italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</jats:italic>-mediated inflammation in colorectal cancer. <jats:italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</jats:italic> is a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium that was first isolated from the oral cavity and identified as a periodontal pathogen. Biofilms on oral squamous cell carcinomas are enriched with anaerobic periodontal pathogens, including <jats:italic>F. nucleatum,</jats:italic> which has prompted hypotheses that this bacterium could contribute to oral cancer development. Recent studies have demonstrated that <jats:italic>F. nucleatum</jats:italic> can promote cancer by several mechanisms; activation of cell proliferation, promotion of cellular invasion, induction of chronic inflammation and immune evasion. This review provides an update on the association between <jats:italic>F. nucleatum</jats:italic> and oral carcinogenesis, and provides insights into the possible mechanisms underlying it.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p><jats:italic>Clostridium</jats:italic> species, as a predominant cluster of commensal bacteria in our gut, exert lots of salutary effects on our intestinal homeostasis. Up to now, <jats:italic>Clostridium</jats:italic> species have been reported to attenuate inflammation and allergic diseases effectively owing to their distinctive biological activities. Their cellular components and metabolites, like butyrate, secondary bile acids and indolepropionic acid, play a probiotic role primarily through energizing intestinal epithelial cells, strengthening intestinal barrier and interacting with immune system. In turn, our diets and physical state of body can shape unique pattern of <jats:italic>Clostridium</jats:italic> species in gut. In view of their salutary performances, <jats:italic>Clostridium</jats:italic> species have a huge potential as probiotics. However, there are still some nonnegligible risks and challenges in approaching application of them. Given this, this review summarized the researches involved in benefits and potential risks of <jats:italic>Clostridium</jats:italic> species to our health, in order to develop <jats:italic>Clostridium</jats:italic> species as novel probiotics for human health and animal production.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Therapy animals in hospital animal-assisted intervention programs are an invaluable part of holistic patient care. However, therapy dogs may be exposed to hospital-associated pathogens through these activities. This pilot study sought to examine the effect of topical chlorhexidine application, used as an infection control measure, on the microbial composition of the skin and mucous membranes of therapy dogs. We found that the chlorhexidine decolonization intervention altered microbial alpha diversity and shifted microbial structures in these therapy dogs, and particularly influenced more phylogenetically rare taxa. Specifically, the intervention reduced the abundance of <jats:italic>Staphylococcus pseudintermedius</jats:italic>, the archetypal canine commensal and a frequent cause of opportunistic infections. However, it did not reduce levels of <jats:italic>S. aureus</jats:italic>, which is a common hospital-associated pathogen of people. These preliminary findings highlight the importance of considering holistic microbial communities when undertaking infection control strategies, and stress the need for further research to understand the unintended consequences of antiseptic use on therapy dogs.</jats:p>},

abstract = {This chapter describes the systematics and evolution of Pasteurellaceae with emphasis on new information generated since the 3rd edition of The Prokaryotes which only included chapters dealing with Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, and Pasteurella. A major source of new information for the current chapter has been provided by whole genome sequences now available for many taxa of the family. Some 100 species and species-like taxa have been documented and 18 genera of Pasteurellaceae reported so far. Members of the family include specialized commensals, potential pathogens, or pathogens of vertebrates and mainly survive poorly in other habitats including the external environment. The pathogenic members are of major importance to animal production and human health. Members of Pasteurellaceae have relatively small genomes, probably as a result of adaption to a special habitat. The most important species in veterinary microbiology include Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, [Haemophilus] parasuis, Mannheimia haemolytica, Bibersteinia trehalosi, and Avibacterium paragallinarum, while Haemophilus influenzae and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans represent the most important species as to human disease. Traditional isolation techniques are still used in both human and veterinary clinical diagnostic laboratories although genetically based diagnostic methods have replaced traditional biochemical/physiological methods for characterization and identification. For all species, MALDI-TOF can now be used as a diagnostic tool. As control and if MALDI-TOF equipment is not at hand, PCR-based specific detection is possible for Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, [Haemophilus] parasuis, Mannheimia haemolytica, Avibacterium paragallinarum, Gallibacterium anatis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. A lot of work has been directed towards identification of virulence factors and understanding host microbe interactions involved in disease.},

abstract = {Roseburia intestinalis is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, slightly curved rod-shaped flagellated bacterium that produces butyrate in the colon. R. intestinalis has been shown to prevent intestinal inflammation and maintain energy homeostasis by producing metabolites. Evidence shows that this bacterium contributes to various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and atherosclerosis. This review reveals the potential therapeutic role of R. intestinalis in human diseases. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease exhibit significant changes in R. intestinalis abundance, and they may benefit a lot from modulations targeting R. intestinalis. The data reviewed here demonstrate that R. intestinalis plays its role in regulating barrier homeostasis, immune cells, and cytokine release through its metabolite butyrate, flagellin and other. Recent advancements in the application of primary culture technology, culture omics, single-cell sequencing, and metabonomics technology have improved research on Roseburia and revealed the benefits of this bacterium in human health and disease treatment.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Oral health has substantial economic importance, with over $100 billion spent on dental care in the United States annually. The microbiome plays a critical role in oral health, yet remains poorly classified. To address the question of how microbial diversity and function in the oral cavities of children relate to caries diagnosis, we surveyed the supragingival plaque biofilm microbiome in 44 juvenile twin pairs. Using shotgun sequencing, we constructed a genome encyclopedia describing the core supragingival plaque microbiome. This unveiled several new previously uncharacterized but ubiquitous microbial lineages in the oral microbiome. Caries is a microbial community metabolic disorder that cannot be described by a single etiology, and our results provide the information needed for next-generation diagnostic tools and therapeutics for caries.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Background Periodontitis is a common inflammatory disease, leading to bone destruction and tooth loss. Screening for periodontitis is important in preventing the progress of this disease. Various types of bacteria have been examined as potential screening targets, but only culturable pathogenic bacteria have been considered candidates. Recently, the various uncultivable bacteria have been identified in microbiome studies, but the value of these bacteria in periodontitis screening remains unknown. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic use of uncultivable bacteria Fretibacterium sp. HOT 360 and TM7 sp. HOT 356 for periodontitis screening in the Japanese population. Material and methods Stimulated saliva samples were collected from 217 participants (periodontitis group, n = 157; healthy group, n = 60). The two uncultivable bacterial species selected were: Fretibacterium sp. human oral taxon 360 (Fretibacterium sp. HOT 360) and TM7 sp. human oral taxon 356 (TM7 sp. HOT 356). The levels of these two bacterial species were compared with those of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), a keystone pathogen in periodontitis. These three species of bacteria were then quantified using qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with specific primers and Taqman probes. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 20.0 software. P value was statistically significant at .05. Results The populations of uncultivable bacterial species TM7 sp. HOT 356 and Fretibacterium sp. HOT 360 were significantly higher in periodontitis group than in healthy group. Only Fretibacterium sp. HOT 360 showed a significantly positive correlation with such periodontal parameters as probing pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BOP). Conclusion These findings indicate that uncultivable bacteria Fretibacterium sp. HOT 360 can be used as a saliva-based diagnostic bacterial biomarker for periodontitis screening.},

abstract = {{Background: Moderate riboflavin deficiency is prevalent in certain population groups in affluent countries, but the functional significance of this deficiency is not clear. Studies have indicated a role for riboflavin in the absorption and use of iron.Objective: We investigated the effect of riboflavin supplementation on hematologic status in a group of moderately riboflavin-deficient women aged 19-25 y in the United Kingdom.Design: One hundred twenty-three women with biochemical evidence of riboflavin deficiency [erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient (EGRAC) \\&gt;1.40] were randomly assigned to receive 2 or 4 mg riboflavin or a placebo for 8 wk. Measurements of hematologic status were made pre- and postsupplementation, and dietary intakes were also assessed; iron absorption was measured in a subgroup of women.Results: One hundred nineteen women completed the intervention. The use of a riboflavin supplement for 8 wk elicited a significant improvement in riboflavin status with a dose response (P \\&lt; 0.0001). For women who received supplemental riboflavin, an increase in hemoglobin status correlated with improved riboflavin status (P \\&lt; 0.02). Women in the lowest tertile of riboflavin status at baseline (EGRAC \\&gt;1.65) showed a significantly greater increase in hemoglobin status in response to the supplement than did women in the first and second tertiles (P \\&lt; 0.01). Dietary iron intake and iron absorption did not change during the study.Conclusions: Moderately poor riboflavin status can affect iron status: the lower the riboflavin status, the greater the hematologic benefits of improving status. The results also suggest that consideration should be given to raising the currently accepted EGRAC threshold for deficiency. This trial was registered at controlled-trials.com as ISRCTN35811298.}},

abstract = {<jats:p> In veterinary medicine, anemia without an appropriate compensatory hematopoietic response is termed nonregenerative. Nonregenerative anemia is a common clinical entity, occurring as a result of diminished or ineffective erythropoiesis in association with many types of pathology. This article reviews nonregenerative anemia in domestic animals, emphasizing mechanisms of disease, and also covers other conditions associated with nonregenerative anemia in people. Many aspects of nonregenerative anemia in animals are worthy of further investigation, from molecular mechanisms of disease to epidemiologic impacts. </jats:p>},

abstract = {<ns3:p>Primary gastric cancer remains one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide. Often patients remain asymptomatic until it is detected at an advanced stage with a poor prognosis. Thus, it's characteristically difficult to initially diagnose until it becomes late stage, at which point prognosis becomes poor. Pernicious anemia is a classic risk factor for the development of primary gastric cancer, but is uncommonly seen in clinical practice. Over time, patients who produce the autoantibodies to intrinsic factor that cause pernicious anemia typically will present initially with clinically significant megaloblastic anemia and peripheral neuropathy. However, patients can also present with more nonspecific signs and symptoms. Thus, clinicians should remain vigilant as circulating anti-intrinsic factor antibodies only worsen the disease over time and increase the risk of developing primary gastric cancer. This report not only presents the rare concurrent diagnosis of pernicious anemia and gastric cancer, but also aims to increase clinical awareness of these two conditions' classic association because early diagnosis and treatment significantly impacts morbidity and mortality.</ns3:p>},

In this study, we examined the effect of the three widely used food-grade preservatives i.e., benzoic acid, potassium sorbate, and sodium nitrite, in recommended levels, on the gut microbiota diversity and composition in a mouse model. The analysis of upbeta-diversity reveals distinct signatures of the gut microbiota between mice consuming different preservatives. Further analyses of upalpha-diversity indices also show that the three preservatives induce specific patterns of microbial diversity, with diversity being lowest in mice consuming potassium sorbate. In terms of bacterial abundance, each of the three preservatives demonstrated unique microbial signatures, mainly affecting the proportions of bacterial taxa belonging to Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Proteobacteria. Specifically, we find the increased proportion of Bacteroides, Blautia, Ruminococcus, Oscillospira, and Dorea in mice fed with benzoate; increased abundance of Firmicutes, Turicibacter, and Alkaliphilus by sodium nitrate; and increased proportion of Parabacteroides and Adlercreutzia by potassium sorbate. The findings improve our understanding of how food-grade preservatives may influence the gut microbiota composition and diversity and should facilitate prospective studies investigating diet-microbiome interactions in relation to intestinal and metabolic health.</jats:p>},

abstract = {{Current anti-dementia drugs cannot benefit mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Sodium benzoate (a D-amino acid oxidase [DAO] inhibitor) has been found to improve the cognitive function of patients with early-phase Alzheimer's disease (mild Alzheimer's disease or MCI). However, its effect on brain function remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of benzoate on functional magnetic resonance imaging in patients with amnestic MCI.This was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 21 patients with amnestic MCI and allocated them randomly to either of 2 treatment groups: (1) benzoate group (250-1500 mg/d), or (2) placebo group. We assessed the patients' working memory, verbal learning and memory, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and regional homogeneity (ReHo) maps at baseline and endpoint.Resting-state ReHo decreased in right orbitofrontal cortex after benzoate treatment but did not change after placebo. Moreover, after benzoate treatment, the change in working memory was positively correlated with the change in ReHo in right precentral gyrus and right middle occipital gyrus; and the change in verbal learning and memory was positively correlated with the change in ReHo in left precuneus. In contrast, after placebo treatment, the change in working memory or in verbal learning and memory was not correlated with the change in ReHo in any brain region.The current study is the first to our knowledge to demonstrate that a DAO inhibitor, sodium benzoate herein, can alter brain activity as well as cognitive functions in individuals with MCI. The preliminary finding lends supports for DAO inhibition as a novel approach for early dementing processes.}},

abstract = {<jats:p>Nucleotide deficiency causes replication stress (RS) and DNA damage in dividing cells. How nucleotide metabolism is regulated in vivo to prevent these deleterious effects remains unknown. In this study, we investigate a functional link between nucleotide deficiency, RS, and the nucleoside salvage pathway (NSP) enzymes deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and thymidine kinase (TK1). We show that inactivation of dCK in mice depletes deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) pools and induces RS, early S-phase arrest, and DNA damage in erythroid, B lymphoid, and T lymphoid lineages. TK1minus/minus erythroid and B lymphoid lineages also experience nucleotide deficiency but, unlike their dCKminus/minus counterparts, they still sustain DNA replication. Intriguingly, dCTP pool depletion, RS, and hematopoietic defects induced by dCK inactivation are almost completely reversed in a newly generated dCK/TK1 double-knockout (DKO) mouse model. Using NSP-deficient DKO hematopoietic cells, we identify a previously unrecognized biological activity of endogenous thymidine as a strong inducer of RS in vivo through TK1-mediated dCTP pool depletion. We propose a model that explains how TK1 and dCK Ux201c[bad char  vv=8220]tuneUx201d[bad char  vv=8221] dCTP pools to both trigger and resolve RS in vivo. This new model may be exploited therapeutically to induce synthetic sickness/lethality in hematological malignancies, and possibly in other cancers.</jats:p>},

At a dose of 50mg/kg, benzoic acid was excreted by the rodents (rat, mouse, guinea pig, golden hamster, steppe lemming and gerbil), the rabbit, the cat and the capuchin monkey almost entirely as hippuric acid (95-100% of 24h excretion). 3. In man at a dose of 1mg/kg and the rhesus monkey at 20mg/kg benzoic acid was excreted entirely as hippuric acid. 4. At 50mg/kg benzoic acid was excreted as hippuric acid to the extent of about 80% of the 24h excretion in the squirrel monkey, pig, dog, ferret, hedgehog and pigeon, the other 20% being found as benzoyl glucuronide and benzoic acid, the latter possibly arising by decomposition of the former. 5. On increasing the dose of benzoic acid to 200mg/kg in the ferret, the proportion of benzoyl glucuronide excreted increased and that of hippuric acid decreased. This did not occur in the rabbit, which excreted 200mg/kg almost entirely as hippuric acid. It appears that the hedgehog and ferret are like the dog in respect to their metabolism of benzoic acid. 6. The Indian fruit bat produced only traces of hippuric acid and possibly has a defect in the glycine conjugation of benzoic acid. The main metabolite in this animal (dose 50mg/kg) was benzoyl glucuronide. 7. The chicken, side-necked turtle and gecko converted benzoic acid mainly into ornithuric acid, but all three species also excreted smaller amounts of hippuric acid.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Significance</jats:title> <jats:p>Mosquitoes are major disease vectors that require a gut microbiota for development into adults under some conditions but not others. To determine the underlying mechanisms for this variation, we determined that dietary riboflavin rapidly decays under most environmental conditions that mosquitoes experience, which makes larvae reliant on their gut microbiota for this essential micronutrient. Our findings illustrate the value of being able to both control and manipulate dietary nutrients, microbiota composition, and environmental conditions in studying the role of gut microbes in animal biology. Our results also suggest environmental conditions are an understudied variable in why the gut microbiota is essential for provisioning certain essential vitamins in aquatic organisms like mosquito larvae.</jats:p>},

Recently, novel roles of B vitamins in the homeostasis of gut microbial ecology and intestinal health continue to be unravelled.

abstract = {{Background: Nightblindness affects 16-52\\% of pregnant women in areas of Nepal and in some cases persists after vitamin A treatment. Iron and riboflavin affect vitamin A utilization and photoreceptor function, respectively, and pilot data in the study population showed a high prevalence of iron and riboflavin deficiencies.Objective: The objective was to assess the effect of supplemental iron and riboflavin on pupillary threshold (PT) and plasma retinol in nightblind, pregnant Nepali women given vitamin A-fortified rice.Design: Nightblind pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive, 6 d/wk under supervision for 6 wk, a vitamin A-fortified rice curry dish providing 850 upmug retinal activity equivalents/d with either a 30-mg Fe and 6-mg riboflavin (FeR + VA) capsule or a placebo control (VA only) capsule. Hemoglobin, erythrocyte riboflavin, and plasma ferritin and retinol were measured before and after the intervention. Dark adaptation was assessed by PT score.Results: Women who were iron deficient at baseline (n = 38) had significantly greater improvement in PT score with iron and riboflavin supplementation than without (P = 0.05). Iron and riboflavin supplements significantly reduced the prevalences of riboflavin deficiency (from 60\\% to 6\\%; P \\&lt; 0.0001), iron deficiency anemia (from 35\\% to 15\\%; P \\&lt; 0.007), and abnormal PT (from 87\\% to 30\\%; P \\&lt; 0.05) from baseline. Mean increases in erythrocyte riboflavin (P \\&lt; 0.0001) and plasma ferritin (P = 0.01) were greater in the FeR + VA group than in the VA only group.Conclusions: Iron deficiency may limit the efficacy of vitamin A to normalize dark adaptation in pregnant Nepali women. Further studies are needed to assess the effect of simultaneous delivery of iron and vitamin A for the treatment of nightblindness.}},

abstract = {The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) was studied in 26 unselected patients with untreated pernicious anemia. RDW changes were also sequentially followed after therapy in 12 patients. The mean (+/- 1 SD) RDW values were significantly higher in pernicious anemia patients than in controls (21.7 +/- 9.1% vs. 13.2 +/- 1.1%, P less than 0.0001). Nevertheless, 31% of the patients had normal RDWs. There were no consistent findings among those who had normal RDW. Most of them were in the early stages of deficiency, but some had advanced deficiency. Over half of those with normal RDW also had normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Overall, 9 of the 26 patients (35%) had normal MCV. Of eight patients whose RDW fell with therapy, some showed a steady fall while others had a transient rise followed by a progressive drop. Despite current advocacy that a high RDW is a sensitive and consistent finding in vitamin B12 deficiency, our findings show that a large proportion of untreated pernicious anemia patients have normal RDWs and that in contrast to iron deficiency, elevation of RDW is not necessarily the earliest indicator of vitamin B12 deficiency.},

abstract = {Benzoic acid is a common food preservative, and salicylic acid (2-hydroxybenzoic acid) is the active form of aspirin. At high concentrations, benzoic acid conducts a proton across the membrane, depleting the proton motive force. In the absence of antibiotics, benzoate exposure selects against proton-driven multidrug efflux pumps and upregulates porins that admit fermentable substrates but that also allow the entry of antibiotics. Thus, evolution with benzoate and related molecules, such as salicylates, requires a trade-off for antibiotic sensitivity, a trade-off that could help define a stable gut microbiome. Benzoate and salicylate are naturally occurring plant signal molecules that may modulate the microbiomes of plants and animal digestive tracts so as to favor fermenters and exclude drug-resistant pathogens.},

abstract = {The relationship among the gut microbiome, global fecal metabolites and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we performed 16S rDNA sequencing and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based nontargeted metabolomic profiling on feces of 26 untreated RA patients and 26 healthy controls. Twenty-six genera and forty-one MS2-identified metabolites were significantly altered in the RA patients. Klebsiella, Escherichia, Eisenbergiella and Flavobacterium were more abundant in the RA patients, while Fusicatenibacter, Megamonas and Enterococcus were more abundant in the healthy controls. Function prediction analysis demonstrated that the biosynthesis pathways of amino acids, such as L-arginine and aromatic amino acids, were depleted in the RA group. In the metabolome results, fecal metabolites including glycerophospholipids (PC(18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z)/16:1(9Z)), lysoPE 19:1, lysoPE 18:0, lysoPC(18:0/0:0)), sphingolipids (Cer(d18:0/16:0), Cer(d18:0/12:0), Cer(d18:0/14:0)), kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid were remarkably altered between the RA patients and healthy controls. Dysregulation of pathways, such as tryptophan metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism, may contribute to the development of RA. Additionally, we revealed that the gut microbiome and metabolites were interrelated in the RA patients, while Escherichia was the core genus.

Results obtained from controlled systems are easier to interpret than those from human/animal studies because observed changes may be specifically attributed to the design conditions imposed on the system. Bioinformatics analysis allowed us to identify potential butyrogenic phylotypes and associated butyrate metabolism pathways when we systematically varied the PH2 in a carefully controlled fermentation system. Our insights may be adapted to butyrate production studies in biohydrogen systems and gut models, since butyrate is a main product and a crucial fatty acid in human/animal colon health.},

An extensive body of research has recently focused on the probiotic effects of this genus, such as biological transformation and its ability to regulate host health and alleviate metabolic syndrome. This article reviews the origin and biological characteristics of Blautia and the factors that affect its abundance and discusses its role in host health, thus laying a theoretical foundation for the development of new functional microorganisms with probiotic properties.},

abstract = {Sarcina ventriculi is a Gram positive organism, which has been reported to be found rarely, in the gastric specimens of patients with gastroparesis. Only eight cases of Sarcina, isolated from gastric specimens have been reported so far. Sarcina has been implicated in the development of gastric ulcers, emphysematous gastritis and gastric perforation. We report a case of 73-year-old male, with history of prior Billroth II surgery and truncal vagotomy, who presented for further evaluation of iron deficiency anemia. An upper endoscopy revealed diffuse gastric erythema, along with retained food. Biopsies revealed marked inflammation with ulcer bed formation and presence of Sarcina organisms. The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for 1 wk, and a repeat endoscopy showed improvement of erythema, along with clearance of Sarcina organisms. Review of reported cases including ours suggests that Sarcina is more frequently an innocent bystander rather than a pathogenic organism. However, given its association with life threatening illness in two reported cases, it may be prudent to treat with antibiotics and anti-ulcer therapy, until further understanding is achieved.},

abstract = {The difference in gut microbiota composition between individuals following vegan or vegetarian diets and those following omnivorous diets is well documented. A plant-based diet appears to be beneficial for human health by promoting the development of more diverse and stable microbial systems. Additionally, vegans and vegetarians have significantly higher counts of certain Bacteroidetes-related operational taxonomic units compared to omnivores. Fibers (that is, non-digestible carbohydrates, found exclusively in plants) most consistently increase lactic acid bacteria, such as Ruminococcus, E. rectale, and Roseburia, and reduce Clostridium and Enterococcus species. Polyphenols, also abundant in plant foods, increase Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, which provide anti-pathogenic and anti-inflammatory effects and cardiovascular protection. High fiber intake also encourages the growth of species that ferment fiber into metabolites as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. The positive health effects of SCFAs are myriad, including improved immunity against pathogens, bloodbrain barrier integrity, provision of energy substrates, and regulation of critical functions of the intestine. In conclusion, the available literature suggests that a vegetarian/vegan diet is effective in promoting a diverse ecosystem of beneficial bacteria to support both human gut microbiome and overall health. This review will focus on effects of different diets and nutrient contents, particularly plant-based diets, on the gut microbiota composition and production of microbial metabolites affecting the host health.},

abstract = {Summary: Bacteroides species are significant clinical pathogens and are found in most anaerobic infections, with an associated mortality of more than 19%. The bacteria maintain a complex and generally beneficial relationship with the host when retained in the gut, but when they escape this environment they can cause significant pathology, including bacteremia and abscess formation in multiple body sites. Genomic and proteomic analyses have vastly added to our understanding of the manner in which Bacteroides species adapt to, and thrive in, the human gut. A few examples are (i) complex systems to sense and adapt to nutrient availability, (ii) multiple pump systems to expel toxic substances, and (iii) the ability to influence the host immune system so that it controls other (competing) pathogens. B. fragilis, which accounts for only 0.5% of the human colonic flora, is the most commonly isolated anaerobic pathogen due, in part, to its potent virulence factors. Species of the genus Bacteroides have the most antibiotic resistance mechanisms and the highest resistance rates of all anaerobic pathogens. Clinically, Bacteroides species have exhibited increasing resistance to many antibiotics, including cefoxitin, clindamycin, metronidazole, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones (e.g., gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin).},

abstract = {The gut microbiota contributes to the regulation of glucose metabolism in pregnancy. Abundance of the genus Collinsella is positively correlated with circulating insulin; however, it is unclear what determines Collinsella abundance. This study aims to validate the correlation between Collinsella and insulin and to elucidate if macronutrient intake alters Collinsella abundance and gut microbiota composition.Gut microbiota profiles were assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing in 57 overweight and 73 obese pregnant women from the SPRING (Study of PRobiotics IN Gestational diabetes) trial at 16weeks gestation and correlated with metabolic hormone levels and macronutrient intake. Gut microbiota composition in the top and bottom 10% of dietary fiber intake was evaluated through network analysis.Collinsella abundance correlated positively with circulating insulin (rho = 0.30, p = 0.0006), independent of maternal BMI, but negatively with dietary fiber intake (rho = 0.20, p = 0.025) in this cohort. Low dietary fiber intake was associated with a gut microbiota favoring lactate fermentation while high fiber intake promotes short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria.Low dietary fiber may enable overgrowth of Collinsella and alter the overall fermentation pattern in gut microbiota. This suggests that dietary choices during pregnancy can modify the nutritional ecology of the gut microbiota, with potential deleterious effects on the metabolic and inflammatory health of the host.Trial registration: ANZCTR 12611001208998, registered 23/11/2011},

The ability of P. cangingivalis to flourish in the different environmental conditions characterized by these two states suggests a degree of metabolic flexibility. To characterize the genes responsible for this, the genomes of 32 isolates (including 18 newly sequenced and assembled) from 18 Porphyromonad species from dogs, humans, and other mammals were compared. Phylogenetic trees inferred using core genes largely matched previous findings; however, comparative genomic analysis identified several genes and pathways relating to heme synthesis that were present in P. cangingivalis but not in other Porphyromonads. Porphyromonas cangingivalis has a complete protoporphyrin IX synthesis pathway potentially allowing it to synthesize its own heme unlike pathogenic Porphyromonads such as Porphyromonas gingivalis that acquire heme predominantly from blood. Other pathway differences such as the ability to synthesize siroheme and vitamin B12 point to enhanced metabolic flexibility for P. cangingivalis, which may underlie its prevalence in the canine oral cavity.},

abstract = {Moraxella is an ocular bacterial pathogen isolated in cases of keratitis, conjunctivitis, and endophthalmitis. Gram-negative brick-shaped diplobacilli from ocular specimens, and slow growth in culture, are early indications of Moraxella ocular infection; however, identifying Moraxella to species can be complex and inconsistent. In this study, bacteria consistent with Moraxella were identified to species using: (1) DNA sequencing coupled with vancomycin susceptibility, (2) MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and (3) the Biolog ID system. Study samples consisted of nine ATCC Moraxella controls, 82 isolates from keratitis, 21 isolates from conjunctivitis, and 4 isolates from endophthalmitis. The ATCC controls were correctly identified. For keratitis, 66 (80.5%) were identified as M.nonliquefaciens, 7 (9.0%) as M. lacunata, 5 (6%) as M. osloensis, 2 (2.5%) as Acinetobacter lwoffii, 1 (1.0%) as M.bovis/nonliquefaciens, and 1 (1.0%) as M.osloensis/nonliquefaciens. For conjunctivitis, 9 (43.0%) were identified as M.osloensis, 6 (29.0%) as M. nonliquefaciens, 3 (14.3%) as Roseomonas, 2 (9.5%) as Acinetobacter (parvus, junii), and 1 (4.5%) as M. catarrhalis/nonliquefaciens. From endophthalmitis, 3 of 4 of the isolates were M.nonliquefaciens. Overall, M. nonliquefaciens and M.osloensis were identified in 70% (75 of 107) and 13% (14 of 107) of cases, respectively, totaling 83% (89 of 107). M. nonliquefaciens and M.osloensis are important bacterial pathogens of the eye as determined by DNA sequencing, MALDI-TOF MS, and Biolog. Although Moraxellacatarrhalis is a clinical pathogen, other species of Moraxella appear to have a prominent role in eye infections.},

abstract = {Background: Abiotrophia and Granulicatella species, previously referred to as nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS), are significant causative agents of endocarditis and bacteraemia. In this study, we reviewed the clinical manifestations of infections due to A. defectiva and Granulicatella species that occurred at our institution between 1998 and 2004. Methods: The analysis included all strains of NVS that were isolated from blood cultures or vascular graft specimens. All strains were identified by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Patients' medical charts were reviewed for each case of infection. Results: Eleven strains of NVS were isolated during the 6-year period. Identification of the strains by 16S rRNA showed 2 genogroups: Abiotrophia defectiva (3) and Granulicatella adiacens (6) or para-adiacens (2). The three A. defectiva strains were isolated from immunocompetent patients with endovascular infections, whereas 7 of 8 Granulicatella spp. strains were isolated from immunosuppressed patients, mainly febrile neutropenic patients. We report the first case of G. para-adiacens bacteraemia in the setting of febrile neutropenia. Conclusion: We propose that Granulicatella spp. be considered as a possible agent of bacteraemia in neutropenic patients.},

One of the compounds known as a preservative with a high safety profile is sodium benzoate. While some studies show that it can be used to treat conditions such as depression, pain, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases, others report its harmfulness. For example, it was found to cause mutagenic effects, generate oxidative stress, disrupt hormones, and reduce fertility. Due to such disparate results, the purpose of this study is to comprehensively discuss the safety profile of sodium benzoate and its potential use in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), and pain relief.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious but usually reversible neuropsychiatric complication of cirrhosis, inborn errors of metabolism involving disorders of the urea cycle, and noncirrhotic portosystemic shunting that most commonly arises from a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting procedure. Symptoms can include alterations in cognitive function, neuromuscular activity, and consciousness, as well as sleep disorders and mood changes. HE is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and, if not properly treated, will lead to increased hospital admissions and healthcare costs. Although the standard therapies of lactulose and rifaximin (Xifaxan, Salix) are effective for most patients, these drugs may be associated with significant adverse effects and expense and, in some patients, inadequate therapeutic response. A need for adjunctive therapies exists. Drugs that target serum and tissue ammonia metabolism and elimination may be important adjuncts to drugs that reduce ammonia production and absorption from the gastrointestinal tract for patients with severe or persistent overt symptoms of HE. Sodium benzoate is an inexpensive adjunctive agent that can be used in addition to lactulose and rifaximin and may provide an option for some select patients with refractory HE who have failed to respond to standard therapies or who cannot afford them. Although sodium benzoate does not share the same adverse effect profiles of standard therapies for HE, its efficacy has not been well established. Given the significant dose-dependent sodium content of this therapy, it may not be appropriate for patients with significant fluid retention or kidney dysfunction.},

abstract = {Detailed physiological studies were done to compare the influence of environmental pH and fermentation end product formation on metabolism, growth, and proton motive force in Sarcina ventriculi. The kinetics of end product formation during glucose fermentation in unbuffered batch cultures shifted from hydrogen-acetate production to ethanol production as the medium pH dropped from 7.0 to 3.3. At a constant pH of 3.0, the production of acetate ceased when the accumulation of acetate in the medium reached 40 mmol/liter. At a constant pH of 7.0, acetate production continued throughout the entire growth time course. The in vivo hydrogenase activity was much higher in cells grown at pH 7.0 than at pH 3.0. The magnitude of the proton motive force increased in relation to a decrease of the medium pH from 7.5 to 3.0. When the organism was grown at pH 3.0, the cytoplasmic pH was 4.25 and the organism was unable to exclude acetic acid or butyric acid from the cytoplasm. Addition of acetic acid, but not hydrogen or ethanol, inhibited growth and resulted in proton motive force dissipation and the accumulation of acetic acid in the cytoplasm. The results indicate that S. ventriculi is an acidophile that can continue to produce ethanol at low cytoplasmic pH values. Both the ability to shift to ethanol production and the ability to continue to ferment glucose while cytoplasmic pH values are low adapt S. ventriculi for growth at low pH.},

abstract = {Background: Megaloblastic, nonregenerative anemia is a wellknown consequence of cobalamin or folate deficiencies in humans but is not recognized in hypocobalaminemic or hypofolatemic dogs. Establishment of relationships between hypocobalaminemia or hypofolatemia and hematologic disease would encourage vitamin B testing, and potentially supplementation, in anemic dogs. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of anemia in hypocobalaminemic or hypofolatemic dogs and to report the prevalence of hypocobalaminemia and hypofolatemia and nonregenerative anemia, macrocytosis, and anisocytosis in anemic dogs. Animals: One hundred and fourteen clientowned dogs with known serum cobalamin and folate concentrations and CBCs and 42 clientowned anemic dogs. Methods: Retrospective comparison of anemia prevalence in hypocobalaminemic or hypofolatemic and normocobalaminemic or normofolatemic dogs was performed. Prospective measurement of erythrocyte variables and cobalamin and folate concentrations in anemic dogs was carried out; relationships among hypocobalaminemia and regenerative status, mean corpuscular volume, and red cell distribution width were evaluated. Results: Significant differences in prevalence of anemia between hypocobalaminemic (36%) and normocobalaminemic dogs (26%; P=.23) or between hypofolatemic (31%) and normofolatemic dogs (30%; P=.99) were not detected. Between hypocobalaminemic and normocobalaminemic dogs, no significant differences in prevalence of nonregenerative anemia (69% vs 63%; P=.65), macrocytosis (17% vs 0%; P=.53), or anisocytosis (28% vs 0%; P=.14) were detected. Anemic dogs had high prevalence of vitamin B deficiencies (nonregenerative: 64% hypocobalaminemic, 18% hypofolatemic; regenerative: 57% hypocobalaminemic, 21% hypofolatemic). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The association between cobalamin and folate deficiencies and macrocytic, nonregenerative anemia established in humans is not routinely present in dogs.},

abstract = {Purpose of review: To review the prevalence, causes and functional significance of vitamin B12 deficiency in vulnerable subpopulations including older adults and the developing embryo. Recent findings: It is becoming increasingly recognized that the susceptibility to vitamin B12 deficiency may change throughout the life cycle, with the developing embryo and older adults exhibiting elevated risk. Recent data implicate low vitamin B12 status as a risk factor for birth defects resulting from improper neural tube development. The potential for vitamin supplementation and/or food fortification to ameliorate the risk of deficiency in these subpopulations is discussed. Summary: The prevalence and impact of vitamin B12 deficiency varies throughout the life cycle, with older adults and potentially the developing embryo having the greatest risk and susceptibility. Additional research is needed to develop effective public health interventions that address the unique causes of this nutritional deficiency, which differ among at-risk subpopulations.},

abstract = {Background:: Observational studies have suggested that vitamin B supplementation is associated with cancer risk, but this association remains controversial. A pooled data-based meta-analysis was conducted to summarize the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of vitamin B supplementation on cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and total mortality. Methods:: PubMed, EmBase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify trials to fit our analysis through August 2015. Relative risk (RR) was used to measure the effect of vitamin B supplementation on the risk of cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and total mortality using a random-effect model. Cumulative meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, heterogeneity tests, and tests for publication bias were also conducted. Results:: Eighteen RCTs reporting the data on 74,498 individuals were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen of these trials included 4103 cases of cancer; in 6 trials, 731 cancer-related deaths occurred; and in 15 trials, 7046 deaths occurred. Vitamin B supplementation had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer (RR: 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.981.10; P=0.216), death due to cancer (RR, 1.05; 95% CI: 0.901.22; P=0.521), and total mortality (RR, 1.00; 95% CI: 0.941.06; P=0.952). Upon performing a cumulative meta-analysis for cancer incidence, death due to cancer, and total mortality, the nonsignificance of the effect of vitamin B persisted. With respect to specific types of cancer, vitamin B supplementation significantly reduced the risk of skin melanoma (RR, 0.47; 95% CI: 0.230.94; P=0.032). Conclusion:: Vitamin B supplementation does not have an effect on cancer incidence, death due to cancer, or total mortality. It is associated with a lower risk of skin melanoma, but has no effect on other cancers.},

abstract = {Background: Hyperammonemia can result in hepatic encephalopathy, which in severe cases eventually can lead to coma and death. In dogs, congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSS) are the most common cause for hyperammonemia. Conservative treatment consists of a protein modified diet, nonabsorbable disaccharides, antibiotics, or some combinations of these. Sodium benzoate (SB) and sodium phenylbutyrate (SPB) both are used in the acute and longterm treatment of humans with hyperammonemia caused by urea cycle enzyme deficiencies. Both treatments are believed to lower blood ammonia concentrations by promoting excretion of excess nitrogen via alternative pathways. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PO treatment with SB and SPB on hyperammonemia and clinical signs in CPSS dogs. Methods: Randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled crossover trial. Concentrations of blood ammonia and bile acids were measured in CPSS dogs before and after a 5day treatment with SB, SPB, and placebo. A washout period of 3days was used between treatments. A standard questionnaire was developed and distributed to owners to evaluate clinical signs before and after each treatment. Results: Blood ammonia concentrations were not influenced by any of the treatments and were comparable to those observed during placebo treatment. In addition, SB and SPB treatment did not result in improvement of clinical signs. Adverse effects during treatment included anorexia, vomiting, and lethargy. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Based on our results, we conclude that SB or SPB are not useful in the conservative treatment of hyperammonemia in dogs with CPSS.},

In recent years, this material has resurfaced as a therapeutic option due to the increasing prevalence of bacterial resistance to antimicrobials. This renewed interest has prompted researchers to investigate how the antimicrobial properties of silver might be enhanced, thus broadening the possibilities for antimicrobial applications. This review presents a compilation of patented products utilizing any forms of silver for its bactericidal actions in the decade 20072017. It analyses the trends in patent applications related to different forms of silver and their use for antimicrobial purposes. Based on the retrospective view of registered patents, statements of prognosis are also presented with a view to heightening awareness of potential industrial and health care applications.},

Samples were mounted on buccal shields of mandibular mouth appliances, which were worn for 24 h except during meals and drinks. Specimens were demineralised extraorally with 0.05 M citric acid (pH 2.3) for 6 x 5 min daily and were treated with test solutions intraorally once per day for 30 s after the first demineralisation. Three solutions were used: placebo (negative control), a commercially available tin- and fluoride-containing (SnF(2)) mouth rinse (positive control, 409 ppm Sn(2+), 250 ppm F(-), pH 4.2) and an experimental solution (pH 4.5) containing 1,900 ppm Sn(2+) (SnCl(2)) and 1,000 ppm F(-) (AmF/NaF). Tissue loss (micrometre) was determined profilometrically. In enamel, tissue loss was 54.8 +/- 8.6 in the placebo, 24.5 +/- 14.4 in the positive control and 9.7 +/- 4.1 in the experimental solution group. The respective values for dentine were 48.5 +/- 13.0 in the placebo, 32.8 +/- 9.6 in the positive control and 26.2 +/- 6.7 in the experimental solution group. The experimental solution was notably effective for enamel but was less effective for dentine. The positive control solution was less effective than the experimental solution; its effects for enamel and dentine were similar.},

abstract = {Periodontal diseases like gingivitis and periodontitis are primarily caused by dental plaque. Several antiplaque and anti-microbial agents have been successfully incorporated into toothpastes and mouthwashes to control plaque biofilms and to prevent and treat gingivitis and periodontitis. The aim of this article was to review recent developments in the antiplaque, anti-gingivitis, and anti-periodontitis properties of some common compounds in toothpastes and mouthwashes by evaluating basic and clinical studies, especially the ones published in the past five years. The common active ingredients in toothpastes and mouthwashes included in this review are chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, sodium fluoride, stannous fluoride, stannous chloride, zinc oxide, zinc chloride, and two herbslicorice and curcumin. We believe this comprehensive review will provide useful up-to-date information for dental care professionals and the general public regarding the major oral care products on the market that are in daily use.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated neurotransmission is vital for learning and memory. Hypofunction of NMDAR has been reported to play a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD), particularly in the early phase. Enhancing NMDAR activation might be a novel treatment approach. One of the methods to enhance NMDAR activity is to raise the levels of NMDA coagonists by blocking their metabolism. This study examined the efficacy and safety of sodium benzoate, a D-amino acid oxidase inhibitor, for the treatment of amnestic mild cognitive impairment and mild AD. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in four major medical centers in Taiwan. Sixty patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or mild AD were treated with 250-750 mg/day of sodium benzoate or placebo for 24 weeks. Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (the primary outcome) and global function (assessed by Clinician Interview Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input) were measured every 8 weeks. Additional cognition composite was measured at baseline and endpoint. RESULTS: Sodium benzoate produced a better improvement than placebo in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (p = .0021, .0116, and .0031 at week 16, week 24, and endpoint, respectively), additional cognition composite (p = .007 at endpoint) and Clinician Interview Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (p = .015, .016, and .012 at week 16, week 24, and endpoint, respectively). Sodium benzoate was well-tolerated without evident side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: Sodium benzoate substantially improved cognitive and overall functions in patients with early-phase AD. The preliminary results show promise for D-amino acid oxidase inhibition as a novel approach for early dementing processes.},

abstract = {Cerebral amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are several molecular species of Abeta, including Abeta40, Abeta42, and Abeta43, and the pathological roles of Abeta43 have attracted particular attention in recent years. Abeta43 is mainly deposited as senile plaques (SPs) in AD brains, and is known to be more amyloidogenic and neurotoxic than Abeta42 and Abeta40. Abeta40 and Abeta42 deposition have been demonstrated in several animal species, while Abeta43 deposition has not been studied in animals. The brains of sea lions, dogs, and cats exhibit unique age-related Abeta pathologies. In the present study, the deposition patterns of Abeta40, Abeta42, and Abeta43 were examined immunohistochemically in the brains of aged dogs (n=52), sea lions (n=5), and cats (n=17). In dogs, most cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) lesions and primitive SPs were positive for Abeta42, Abeta43, and Abeta40. However, diffuse SPs and capillary CAA lesions were negative for Abeta40. In sea lions, all SPs and most CAA lesions were positive for Abeta42, Abeta43, and Abeta40, while capillary CAA lesions were negative for Abeta40. In cats, Abeta42-immunopositive granular aggregates and arteriole and capillary CAA lesions were positive for Abeta43, but negative for Abeta40. Double-labelling immunohistochemistry revealed the co-localization of Abeta42 and Abeta43. These findings suggest that Abeta43 and Abeta42 are frequently deposited in the brains of Carnivora animals and may play an important role in Abeta pathology.},

abstract = {The hydrotropy though existing as precisely used scientific approach assisting solubilization for all. It took 66 long years to use the concept in drug analysis since its inception in 1916 and first use for facilitation of drug solubility toward better pharmaceutical analysis in 1982. Considering the unending importance in pharmaceutical sciences and thereby in analysis, it's a necessity to comprehensively outlook the origin, evolution, cumulative trend and precise applications in pharmaceutical analysis. Achieved hereby with chronological and comparative assessment of the studies published pertaining to solubility enhancement of poorly soluble drugs with use of hydrotropic agents alone or in combination for assisting pharmaceutical analysis. The thorough literature searches resulted into 77 references over a span of about 38 years. This comprehensive review critically evaluates existing literature; to our surprise we found Ibuprofen sodium, Lignocaine, Niacinamide and Metformin HCl as atypical hydrotropic agents. We also compared herein mono and mixed approaches which indicated prevalence of mono - hydrotropy over mixed. The possible mechanisms behind solubilization are presented for an additional insight. An essential effort has been made to state arbitrary classification to assist in future applications. The obvious purpose of this study was to collectively evaluate the crucial role of hydrotropic agents in pharmaceutical analyses for better drug delivery. This comprehensive review covers all details since inception to the updates till date which will definitely act as appropriate guideline for pharmaceutical analyst's in need of hydrotropy to assist pharmaceutical analysis for therapies today and tomorrow.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common long-term sequelae after total gastrectomy. Intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 is the only known treatment. We investigated the efficacy and safety of oral vitamin B12 replacement for gastric cancer patients with vitamin B12 deficiency after total gastrectomy. METHODS: We performed a single-arm, open-label, fixed-drug dosage, prospective study (NCT00699478) involving gastric cancer patients who underwent total gastrectomy. Vitamin B12-deficient (<200 pg/ml) patients (n = 30) received daily oral vitamin B12 (dosage: 1500 mug mecobalamin) administration for 3 months. The primary outcome measurement was serum vitamin B12. The secondary outcome measurements were improvement of neurologic symptoms and hematologic findings (serum folate, homocysteine, ferritin, iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin, and mean corpuscular volume). For comparison, another group of vitamin B12 deficient patients (n = 30) received intramuscular vitamin B12 injections (dosage: 1000 mug cyanocobalamin) weekly for 5 weeks and monthly thereafter for a total of 3 months in a separate study period. RESULTS: In both groups, mean serum vitamin B12 increased after 30 days of treatment and was maintained up to 90 days. No adverse effects related to oral or intramuscular vitamin B12 replacements were noted. Both groups showed decreased homocysteine levels. Before treatment, 29 patients in the oral vitamin B12 group had neurologic symptoms related to vitamin B12 deficiency. After oral vitamin B12 treatment, 28 patients experienced symptom relief, and 16 patients were symptom free. CONCLUSIONS: Oral vitamin B12 replacement is an effective and safe treatment for vitamin B12 deficiency in gastric cancer patients after total gastrectomy.},

abstract = {Sodium benzoate (NaB) is a versatile food preservative that has also found some applications in the treatment of medical disorders. However, till date, its possible widespread effects on the body are not well studied. We examined the likely effect of diet-added NaB on weight/food intake, haematological parameters, neurobehaviour, antioxidant status, lipid profile and anti-inflammatory/apoptotic markers in mice. Animals were assigned randomly into 4 groups of 10 mice each. Groups included normal control (fed rodent chow) and three groups fed NaB at 125 (0.0125%), 250 (0.025% and 500 (0.05%) mg/kg of feed added to diet, respectively, for eight weeks. Body weight and food intake were assessed. At the end of the experimental period animals were euthanized, blood was then taken for the assessment of haematological, biochemical and inflammatory/apoptotic markers. At the lowest concentration, NaB diet increased body weight and food intake. Decrease in haematological cell counts and total antioxidant capacity were observed, whereas serum malondialdehyde levels and superoxide dismutase activity were increased across the three concentrations. Serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-10 decreased, whereas caspase-3 levels showed no significant difference. Lipid profile and biochemical indices of kidney and liver function were also affected by NaB diet. In conclusion, our findings suggest that NaB may be harmful if regulations regarding its limit of consumption are mistakenly or deliberately ignored. Therefore, it is advisable that regulations on quantities to be added to food be enforced.},

abstract = {This study investigated the changes induced on nylon 6,6 fabric by a mixture of proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes. Technical measurements were studied including those of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), weight loss (WL), bending lengths (BL), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), moisture absorbency (MA), and reflectance spectroscopy (RS). For this purpose, nylon 6,6 fabrics were treated separately with different concentrations of protease and lipase mixtures in solution. The dyeing process was then carried out on the treated fabrics with two reactive and acid dyes. The intensity of major peaks in the FTIR spectra of the protease-treated samples is in favor of chemical changes the polypeptide functional groups in the fabrics. Thermal studies also show a significant decrease in the thermal degradation temperature of the treated polymer at temperatures higher than 400 degrees C. The protease and lipase mixtures decreased the sample weight, while lipase intensified the weight loss comparing with protease. It was observed that the concentration of lipase enzyme had a direct influence on the darkness of dyed samples.},

abstract = {When benzoate (2 mM, pH 3.5) was added together with glucose (0.1 M) to a suspension of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the stationary phase, it caused a relative increase in the concentration of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate and a decrease in the concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. These effects are in confirmation of similar observations made by Krebs et al. [Biochem. J. 214, 657-663 (1983)] and are indicative of an inhibition of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase. Benzoate also caused an about fourfold relative decrease in the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, an increase in that of cyclic AMP with no change in that of ATP. It also greatly decreased the activation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, but not that of trehalase, both of which normally occur upon addition of glucose to a yeast suspension. When added 10 min after glucose, benzoate caused a rapid (within 2-3 min) decrease in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration and in 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity. In the presence of benzoate, there was also a parallel decrease in the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and in the rate of ethanol production when the external pH was dropped from 5.0 to 2.5, with minimal change in the concentration of ATP. Purified 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase was inhibited by benzoate and also by an acid pH. Experiments with cell-free extracts did not provide an explanation for the rapid disappearance of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate or the inactivation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase in yeast upon addition of benzoate.},

abstract = {Background/Aims: To determine the nutritional markers important for assessing the degree of pancreatic insufficiency due to chronic pancreatitis in routine clinical practice. Methods: A total of 137 patients with chronic pancreatitis were followed up for more than 1 year. They were divided into two groups: a pancreatic diabetes mellitus (DM) group, consisting of 47 patients undergoing medical treatment for DM of pancreatic origin, and a nonpancreatic DM group, consisting of 90 other patients (including 86 patients without DM). Serum albumin, prealbumin, total cholesterol, cholinesterase, magnesium, and hemoglobin were compared between the two groups. Results: The total cholesterol was significantly lower in the pancreatic than the nonpancreatic DM group (164 mg/dL vs 183 mg/dL, respectively; p=0.0028). Cholinesterase was significantly lower in the former group (263 U/L vs 291 U/L, respectively; p=0.016). Among the 37 patients with nonalcoholic pancreatitis, there was no difference in the cholinesterase levels between the pancreatic and nonpancreatic (296 U/L vs 304 U/L, respectively; p=0.752) DM groups, although cholesterol levels remained lower in the former (165 mg/dL vs 187 mg/dL, respectively; p=0.052). Conclusions: Cholinesterase levels are possibly affected by concomitant alcoholic liver injury. The total cholesterol level should be considered when assessing pancreatic insufficiency due to chronic pancreatitis.},
